[Dennis] I'm going to present United Airlines Accessibility Journey. The agenda tonight will be just a little bit of introduction of why we even visited accessibility, some background as well as sort of the plan that we took, and how we executed on that plan. If there's time I will do a demonstration and then sort of a communicate you know what our plans are for the future and then there'll hopefully be a little bit of time for some Q&A.

## So some background ...

Many of you may or may not know this but United Airlines was created by William Boeing, who started out in the airplane business in 1916. His company, the Boeing Airplane Company as it was called then, achieved the first international postal delivery in 1919. He went on to establish the United Aircraft Corporation in 1928

## Speeding up to today

It's one of ... United Airlines is one of the fastest ... sorry largest airline ...  definitely not fastest ... what was I saying there ... in the world, with over 87,000 employees and more than 700 mainline aircraft. In 2016, we flew approximately 143 million passengers serving more than 330 destinations in 54 countries with more than 4,500 daily departures.

## Tech for All

Tech for All is the agency ... the consultancy that we used to help us out with our accessibility endeavor. They have been around since 2001. Their mission is to serve clients with a commitment to make their products, services and websites accessible to all people, including those living with disabilities. They provided end-to-end accessibility solutions for a wide range of digital products, applications and websites and also for producers of digital content.

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,220
When we were going through the agencies to figure out which one to go with,

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,680
they had some airline experience, but they were very heavy in the higher education field.

37
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,780
But some of their work that they did in that field we found interesting

38
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,060
and sort of, you know, caused us to look at them a little bit closer.

39
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,460
TFA's services include training, planning, designing,

40
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,800
development, support, evaluation, testing, remediation,

41
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,060
implementation and monitoring.

42
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:11,500
Support for United Airline since March of 2015 for accessibility of its website,

43
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,740
airport kiosk, mobile apps and in-flight Wi-Fi portal.

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,980
So, the reason why we involve them was due to

45
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,520
the Air Carriers Access Act.

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,960
How many people here have actually heard of that?

47
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,060
Okay about a third to almost a half.

48
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,800
You know, air travel for the longest period of time
 
49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
has been viewed as a luxury.

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,920
But nowadays it is the main form of moving

51
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,220
from point A to point B

52
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,340
especially since people travel not only from town to town

53
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,400
but actually from state to state and country to country.

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,500
So the Air Carrier Access Act actually prohibits

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,980
discrimination on the basis of disability in air travel

56
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,220
and requires air carriers to accommodate the needs

57
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,220
of passengers with disabilities.

58
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,140
It's not just for the web, it's actually, you know,

59
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,140
when you have someone with a disability,

60
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,480
he boards an aircraft, getting them to the aircraft, getting them off the aircraft.

61
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,400
As you may know, we have been in the news in the past for some issues with that.

62
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,920
So the Air Carrier's Access Act actually covers not only digital but actually in the real world.

63
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,240
So in 2013, there was an amendment to this rule

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,300
requiring both US and foreign air carriers

65
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,560
to make their websites that market air transportation

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,280
to the general public in the United States

67
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,780
accessible to individuals with disabilities,

68
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,560
in addition to kiosks at least twenty five percent by 2022.

69
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,580
So what does this mean for United Airlines?

70
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,540
Back in 2013 ... this came out in November 2013,

71
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:16,080
we knew nothing about accessibility or what it meant to be accessible

72
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,940
So we really had to start from scratch, you know,

73
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,400
people with disabilities have to be able to use the website;

74
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,820
perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the website.

75
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,440
The WCAG 2, what I just mentioned a little while ago,

76
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,140
those accessibility guidelines provide some direction

77
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,540
techniques and success criteria that can be used to

78
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,820
ensure website accessibility to address various disabilities.

79
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,160
So the question was, how are we going to do this?

80
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,040
We had to review our flight plan.

81
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,040
So first steps we need to review the needs, outline plans,

82
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,060
get up to speed with the guidelines and you know

83
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,060
the guidelines, as you'll find out next month

84
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,140
it's over a thousand pages of information that you need to digest,

85
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:18,160
so it's really not something that is just you know cliff notes, read it, ok I'm ready to go.

86
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,440
We went through a process of selecting

87
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,400
an accessibility consulting firm to try to audit

88
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,080
the website, provide recommendations

89
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,320
and sort of the next steps of

90
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,620
how we were going to remediate the website.

91
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,940
Internally we do not have a formal team.

92
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,040
Basically was people with various focuses

93
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,740
and disciplines that ... and a part-time basis

94
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,260
worked with our agency to remediate the website.

95
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,260
It involved user experience, front-end web development,

96
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,780
user acceptance testing, requirements writing,

97
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,840
digital production and editorial disciplines.

98
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,820
We also own joined an organization called

99
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,660
Airlines for America. They're not accessibility specific.

100
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,820
They work as a liaison between the airlines and the DOT

101
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,060
to ensure that we are following the rules.

102
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,880
So...

103
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,500
to get to the implementation plan,

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
we went through various phases.

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So Phase One was evaluation.

106
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,400
We performed web site audits of

107
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,140
not only of united.com but mobile apps.

108
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,780
Content migration audit.

109
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:55,480
We were actually in the midst of a CMS migration

110
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,060
from one to another which actually we stopped doing midstream.

111
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,760
So there was quite a bit of double work.

112
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,320
We reviewed the 2.0 designs.

113
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,140
So what when I say 1.0 and  2.0 ...

114
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:14,260
what you see today, on the homepage and on the booking path,

115
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,640
that is considered 2.0.

116
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,140
1.0 is the old look.

117
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,480
So when I'm referring to these different versions,

118
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
you'll know what I'm referring to.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And then our vendor also created

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,680
an accessibility discovery and roadmap.

121
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,000
Phase two was the actual remediation.

122
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,640
So we received training by TFA,

123
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,080
both the designers and developers

124
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,740
on how to make things accessible.

125
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,880
We receive guidance and expertise by TFA

126
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,340
for the various remediation teams.

127
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:56,040
We ...  because of the amount of work to be performed,

128
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,380
we had to break up into, sort of into agile pods

129
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
to audit all the various parts

130
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,080
and mind you one thing that's unique to airline websites,

131
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,540
especially ones that have merged and not replatformed

132
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,560
is that you have a lot of old code.

133
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,660
I mean I cannot tell you how many times I saw

134
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,600
font tag out there.

135
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,140
So after we perform the remediation,

136
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,240
TFA would perform additional reviews

137
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,540
through various working sessions we held.

138
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,000
And they also coordinated usability testing

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,740
with disability groups ... December of 2014, sorry 2015.

140
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,940
We we partnered with ... trying to think of the name ...

141
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,020
ah shoot, shoot shoot shoot, it's a disability group that

142
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,460
helps individuals with vision impairments in particular,

143
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,000
but they also helped us with various other disabilities

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,340
come in for testing.

145
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,520
I have to say it was probably one the most rewarding days in accessibility

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,860
was actually watching someone succeed and fail in using the website.

147
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:27,140
One of the revelations that I encountered was someone who ...

148
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,940
the WCAG guidelines say that you have to be able to zoom the website up to two hundred percent.

149
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,020
Well I watched people zooming the website up to five hundred percent.

150
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,460
And as you can imagine there's a lot of moving around to actually be able to to digest the content.

151
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,840
And then Phase 3 was the actual implementation.

152
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,400
So as far as executing on this plan we had

153
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,460
three different teams of experts; web, kiosk,

154
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,140
and the team working on the accessible road map.

155
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,340
So Phase one was three parallel tracks to complete

156
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,340
web audits in five weeks.

157
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,800
When you see the number of things we had to audit

158
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,860
and review, five weeks is amazing.

159
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,860
I still don't know how it was done.

160
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,720
Phase 2, the web team supported remediation

161
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,980
and evaluated the results of that remediation.

162
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,380
And then Phase 3 was the actual implementation.

163
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
We had a web team working on

164
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,200
the actual implementation of the 2015 and 2016 deadlines.

165
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,160
The DOT mandated accessibility in two phases.

166
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,260
The first phase, which was 2015, was for the seven core functions;

167
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,920
that's primarily your booking, your loyalty, check-in,

168
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,860
flight status, those sort of task-based functions

169
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
of a airline website.

170
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,700
2016 was everything else.

171
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,740
We had a separate kiosk team,

172
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:15,880
who worked to make the kiosk compliant with the DOT regulations.

173
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,240
and that was at the end of 2016.

174
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,820
TFA, our agency, then addressed the continuing compliance.

175
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:34,580
So before we started this implementation, the disability community really struggled with our website

176
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,380
due to various barriers.

177
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:45,300
Not a person with disability but in the early stages when I was trying to create awareness,

178
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,740
I got one of our managing directors in a conference room

179
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,040
and so this way he would understand the gravity of accessibility problems,

180
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,720
I set him up with a laptop, I set him up with a mouse,

181
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,360
and I said okay, go ahead and book a flight from the homepage.

182
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,080
As he went over to reach the mouse, 
I quickly unplugged it

183
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,420
So he thought it was rather rude.

184
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,720
So then his hands went to the trackpad and I place cardboard over it.

185
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,860
And I told him ok now book and
be glad I didn't turn off the screen.

186
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,540
So he, just using the keyboard, attempted to book a flight and he never got off the homepage.

187
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,560
At that point he was blown away ... 
I think he uttered an expletive.

188
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,480
And our internal movement really took off after that.

189
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,320
So before the remediation, blind customers ...

190
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,140
multiple WCAG 2.0 and some usability issues

191
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,820
created major barriers for users with a screen reader

192
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,020
rendering most of our new website booking path

193
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,280
interface inaccessible.

194
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,540
One of the problems was that ...

195
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,560
the new website had gone through so much development and we were so far along,

196
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,760
that it wasn't like we could change the design,

197
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:23,240
which is another reason why you really want to bake in accessibility up front at the design stage,

198
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,220
even in the planning for design stage.

199
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,400
Low vision customers found issues with

200
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,700
insufficient color contrast for text and sometimes

201
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
even using color as a reference.

202
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:42,000
We had portions of our website where we would say click the green button.

203
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:52,100
If you've ever viewed a web page or website with an extension on the browser

204
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:58,780
that can change it based on different color blindness deficiencies, you'll soon realize that

205
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
you don't know what button to click.

206
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,540
For mobility impaired customers,

207
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,240
many of our user interface elements

208
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,220
could not be operated using only the keyboard.

209
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,640
I kid you not, as I was coming over here I was telling some folks who arrived here early

210
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,140
a new section of the website that is getting ready
to be launched,

211
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:29,080
come to find out that certain things weren't looked at for accessibility.

212
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,920
So they reached out to me, and they said okay so when we get here,

213
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,880
when we click on, when we tab through, we can't get to that button over there.

214
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,120
Now the funny thing is I had to be logged in and I was having difficulty logging in

215
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
and so they sent me a screenshot,

216
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,840
which doesn't really make it easy to review the code if they're not providing the code panel.

217
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,300
So I said "explain to me what happens?"

218
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,740
They said, well we tab, we hit this, hit this, and then we hit this which is right after the button.

219
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:06,420
I said I can probably guess that that's not a button
or an input.

220
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,160
that's probably a div that's wrapped around
text that says continue

221
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,560
and there's no tabindex there's nothing saying that the button.

222
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,880
So you don't know how to interact with it.

223
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,720
And then they the person on the call this morning they look at that yeah how did you know?

224
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,880
It's like because I've seen it 350 other times from the last couple years.

225
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,060
So at least I could tell them how to fix that.

226
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,480
Another thing that we encountered during this journey

227
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,720
of ours is the disability community

228
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,260
really communicated their displeasure with our website.

229
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,280
These are three tweets before we implemented

230
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
the first phase of implementation.

231
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,800
For those that can't see, this is a little bit small,

232
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,820
but this was actually during a conference

233
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,180
where they used our website as an example,

234
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,460
a bad example ... before remediation.

235
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,500
And it says here "united website doesn't allow

236
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,160
blind people to buy flights online yikes"

237
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,800
and then the hashtags #accessibility and #usertestplease

238
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,080
Over here we have

239
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,140
"united i have us have had a similar problem

240
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,840
general website & accessibility on chrome for the mac

241
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,600
fine on firefox tweeted on thursday got nothing."

242
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,620
And then lastly, "united i use minimum font size

243
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,080
in my browser for accessibility but now the new website

244
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,900
won't let me search for flights pages broken."

245
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,200
As you can imagine, that's an issue. We're basically blocking people from performing a task

246
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:55,280
that other people using a mouse or other input devices are able to do.

247
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,640
Additionally, we receive feedback this is an early version

248
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,820
in development of the website.

249
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,100
If you notice, we have a lot of issues.

250
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,280
This is, once again, a little bit small,

251
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,140
but you can see that there's plenty of color contrast

252
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,240
issues; you know text / photographic imagery

253
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,560
where you can't read it, small font sizes,

254
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,500
What is ...okay personal tangent ...

255
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,880
what is up with the small font sizes?

256
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:42,480
I mean I'm over a half a century old and anytime I have to get within the foot of the monitor read it,

257
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,660
it's too small.

258
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,900
So yeah please ... please increase those font sizes.

259
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,120
Trust me it's going to be a trend, it's going to be sexy someday, just enlarge it.

260
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,980
Yeah being able to use a website is sexy ... there you go.

261
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,560
And also consistently poor feedback and ratings

262
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,120
from customers ... that that will actually do it

263
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,600
each and every time.

264
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,880
So a safety check ... key challenges ...

265
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,180
we had to educate everyone involved

266
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,840
in both general understanding as well as

267
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,640
specific role-based learning and training on accessibility

268
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,280
both in-house and offshore resources.

269
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:36,400
At the time, we had, for 2.0, we had onshore resources remediating and for 1.0, we had offshore.

270
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:43,880
The problem there is, we had to use a completely different methodology in writing up requirements.

271
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:52,160
For onshore, we were told not to tell how to remediate just what to remediate.

272
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,280
For offshore, we were told not only how to remediate but,

273
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,260
I mean what to remediate but explicitly how to remediate it.

274
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,360
So you found that so many times asking, ok, who's doing, who's remediating this okay

275
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,140
and then we had the right to requirements appropriately.

276
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,780
Buy-in of internal stakeholders.

277
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,800
Educating them on the scope

278
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
and ramifications of the project

279
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,560
and then the placement of the business priorities.

280
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:28,720
As you can imagine, releasing a new website design, especially one that has been delayed

281
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,320
for quite some time, and now everyone wants their portion of the website to look brand-new

282
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:42,040
and we say we can't do that where we're actually making it accessible and there may not be any visible changes

283
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,720
that's very difficult to sell to a business stakeholder.

284
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,600
And then also as far as resources,

285
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,760
the part time team with multiple responsibilities.

286
00:20:52,920 --> 00:21:01,240
So for myself, I was helping set remediation requirements for the various parts of

287
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:08,480
the 2.0 website for the first phase.

288
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,400
Last year, I was divided amongst the rest of the site in helping with the remediation,

289
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,840
but also remediating the rest of the site for content.

290
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,400
So last year was a very busy year.

291
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,200
Design and development of a new website

292
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,240
already in progress requiring remediation

293
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,000
rather than design. Very costly.

294
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,840
Remediation is always more costly than baking it in

295
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,840
upfront at the beginning.

296
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,960
Time to completion in scope.

297
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
You know you would think that

298
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,400
we had a total for the entire website of three years

299
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,120
to make it accessible.

300
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,840
You don't realize how much time you really need.

301
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,160
We literally finished about a week before.

302
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,760
So it was very stressful.

303
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,760
The scope of the mandates required us

304
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
to divide and conquer.

305
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,080
Address kiosk software and hardware,

306
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,320
split the website into core pages,

307
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,880
content-driven pages

308
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,760
and third-party vendor responsibilities.

309
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,760
We have a lot of subdomains that are actually managed

310
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,360
by third parties and then trying to get them up to speed.

311
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
What we wanted to do is say

312
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,760
"here's WCAG, learn it, fix the website."

313
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,560
They still came to us asking us questions all the time,

314
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,960
so that really did not work.

315
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Partnerships.

316
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,560
Integration of accessibility partner

317
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
to implementation activities

318
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,200
We brought TFA, our partner,

319
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,040
and appropriate touch points from audit

320
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,920
to recommendations to training.

321
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,720
We did again usability testing by people with disabilities

322
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,360
and we also started developing relationships

323
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,520
with various groups, most recently

324
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,840
we created a relationship with the

325
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,080
American Federation of the Blind and

326
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
the Chicago Lighthouse for the Blind.

327
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,080
And then of course the logistical challenges in terms of

328
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,400
equipment, devices, tools, online versus in person.

329
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,880
We could only do testing in person.

330
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,720
You know for other user testing that we do we do a mix,

331
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,040
but with individuals with disabilities, that's  very difficult.

332
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:37,880
It's not possible because the methods in doing remote testing are themselves not accessible.

333
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
And then ongoing training.

334
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,400
Continuing to spread the word to others.

335
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,280
We're training and education becomes important.

336
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,720
I'm still doing that today.

337
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,240
One of the things that we found is as soon as you train people, people leave

338
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,880
and now you have to train new people.

339
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,480
The groups themselves don't keep the information.

340
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,480
They don't create a knowledge base within their groups,

341
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,120
they depend on us to retrain and recreate awareness.

342
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,840
Different disciplines and practices that have

343
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,240
different roles learning how to do their part and

344
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,040
how they fit together.

345
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:28,440
One of the things I will say on the positive is, we had some tremendous advocates in the business.

346
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,480
... because then she probably kick me in the shins tomorrow,

347
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:40,440
but she's on the advertising side, so you think okay so what's the big deal.

348
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:47,960
Ads themselves also have to be accessible and would not think that this would be so difficult.

349
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,200
But when you're dealing with third-party ads using API's that hit a distribution system

350
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,640
which are hitting a source system that can be very difficult and

351
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:08,760
this particular individual really hung in there, wanted to learn, embraced it and really made my life much easier.

352
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:17,120
... yeah, like ad banners and and for these particular ones these were a third party ads.

353
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,120
So Take off.

354
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,600
So in 2015 and 2016, here's where we round up some numbers.

355
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,680
There were 1421 application pages

356
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,480
that needed to be remediated.

357
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:40,520
and again, you know, seeing the same problems over and ... that's actually a blessing.

358
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,440
When you establish a pattern where, this table is coded just like this table and they're all bad

359
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:52,480
you could sort of just write the requirements for each one of these the same way so that actually did help us.

360
00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:04,360
But ... font tags. Come on ... I actually had the figure out what are the attributes for font tags.

361
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,800
600 content pages.

362
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
26 videos.

363
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,040
You may think okay what's the big deal?

364
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:25,800
Well 26 videos that did not have custom captions, they had YouTube's auto captions.

365
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,360
Well we all know what that's like.

366
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:37,440
When we first started, I watched in-flight safety video, and I watched the auto captions.

367
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,120
I mean talk about damaging to the brand.

368
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,360
I mean, yeah, some of those words should not be used in anything that's on video for United Airlines.

369
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,160
But besides that not only the captions

370
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,760
but how we are delivering them you know just embedding the YouTube player,

371
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,360
the YouTube player is not up to WCAG 2 AA.

372
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,360
So we had to find a player that would handle YouTube videos and then of course we found all the issues

373
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:12,160
with regards to that you might think okay fine that's perfect and you're done.

374
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:22,320
Not when you realize that there's information embedded in the video that's not being passed across audibly.

375
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:30,800
For instance for our in-flight entertainment they would embed the name of the film,

376
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,720
but it's never being communicated. Well isn't at the point of the video?

377
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,600
To know what videos are going to be displayed you know are to be presented in flight for a given month?

378
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,160
And then 108 PDFs.

379
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,800
Gawd ... PDFs.

380
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
What can I say.

381
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,360
Funny, we had two days of training on how to remediate PDFs.

382
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:05,560
And then about a month later 
we said yeah that's not going to work 
so then we just started hitting the Delete key.

383
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:16,640
Let's touch upon here, we begin with over 1600 PDFs, the left it with 108.

384
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,400
Many of those believe it or not we're back from 2001.

385
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,080
How relevant were those? Our web servers in some areas are basically storage servers.

386
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,040
You know mergers and acquisitions.

387
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,960
Challenges includes video player, closed captioning,

388
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,960
route map.

389
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:48,280
Ok, so our old route map, we had two of them, one domestic one international, and they were PDFs.

390
00:28:49,440 --> 00:29:03,400
I think each PDF had about 1200 curved lines going from various hubs and I would tell that the design group

391
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:10,480
who would actually update these on a monthly basis, it's like you do realize that I can't get nothing out of this.

392
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,120
Oh yes you can. I said so what route did you add? I added this route. I go, where's the line?

393
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
Um...

394
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:28,160
Our current route map uses the Google Maps API. It provides the information textually,

395
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:34,320
but also allows for the graphical lines that you would expect. So it's actually pretty cool.

396
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,600
Friendly skies. That's what we want, right?

397
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,800
After our remediation

398
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,360
we immediately started getting positive feedback.

399
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,000
This is a tweet here "nice job United on the new website.

400
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,680
Thanks for moving the web forward

401
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,440
with your attention paid to accessibility."

402
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,400
This is an email that we actually received the key here is

403
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,680
"noticed improvements in the ability to select a fare

404
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,440
and seat from the seat map. Great stuff!"

405
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:17,840
I can't tell you how valuable, how impactful it is to make a seat map accessible to individuals with disabilities.

406
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:25,440
The key here in making things accessible is providing independence for everyone.

407
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:31,040
We take it for granted because we've been doing it forever. It's not until you don't have it

408
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:41,320
and especially if you once had it and now you don't. You have something to compare to and that's when it becomes very impactful.

409
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,200
We actually made Marcy Sutton's blog.

410
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,840
She runs a blog called Accessibility Wins,

411
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,280
where basically she points out accessibility wins,

412
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,560
typically they are portions of a website.

413
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,520
In this case she just targeted the entire website

414
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,800
and said great job.

415
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,240
So you might want to check that out.

416
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,240
Read the entire article on that.

417
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,800
Another thing we noticed is that

418
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,560
we have Opinion Labs hooked up to the website.

419
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,640
You'll note that little green tab, which by the way now is accessible,

420
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,680
It's pretty bad when you make the website accessible

421
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,200
but yet if someone wants to provide feedback

422
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,440
they can't get to it.

423
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,440
We had to make that accessible.

424
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,600
Right after the implementation of our accessibility,

425
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:41,200
you'll notice that we went from this many complaints down to practically none.

426
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,800
Now it's not to say that we're perfect.

427
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,320
In fact if you think of it a website is constantly changing.

428
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,480
We won an award.

429
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,040
The American Federation of the Blind awarded

430
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,560
United Airlines they're Blind Access Award.

431
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,640
The access award honors individuals and corporations

432
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,040
that eliminate or substantially reduce inequity

433
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,400
faced by people with vision loss.

434
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,320
We actually received this award last Friday.

435
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,960
Representatives from our team that did much of the

436
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,120
remediation attended the ceremony last Friday.

437
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,320
So the project really was to remediate the website.

438
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,160
But you have to think about okay what about the future?

439
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,520
I mean how you going to keep the website accessible?

440
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,760
So we are looking at applying universal design

441
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,800
principles.

442
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,960
We have recently started moving to agile.

443
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
Yeah I know. It's taken a while.

444
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,160
But it's one of the challenges is with that is

445
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,560
to make sure each pod is at the same level

446
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:52,200
of universal design and incorporating accessibility

447
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
that's something that we're having to deal with

448
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,640
at this current time.

449
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,440
Automated testing tools.

450
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,720
A little bit over a year ago we met with

451
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,920
at least eight vendors of automated testing tools

452
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:15,000
things like Tenon and the SSB Bart product AMP

453
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,120
We met with various vendors.

454
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,600
They demonstrated their tools, some of them are free

455
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,840
some of them are very pricey.

456
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,440
It basically is based on how much of a dashboard they provide

457
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:35,800
Today we still do not have an automated tool implemented.

458
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Now there's actually two types of tools.

459
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:45,000
So there's your manual tool like WebAim's Wave tool that can test page by page,

460
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:53,320
And then there's tools like Tenon and other things that will actually scan a group of pages if not the entire website.

461
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,400
We don't have that yet, but with either tool whether it be a page based or site based,

462
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:09,680
automated tools are only good up to about thirty percent so they're going to catch your low hanging fruit.

463
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,960
They're going to catch whether you're missing an alt attribute, you know code base pattern.

464
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,600
So they're going to catch if you don't have a label tag associated with an input field.

465
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:30,560
But they're not going to catch if you know, you have the word file name in as the alt text for an ad.

466
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,320
So they're not going to check on the more qualitative things.

467
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,440
Documenting.

468
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,320
I don't think ... to this day we have spotty documentation

469
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,640
here and there but we don't have an actual global set

470
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,240
of documentation and I know that we are working on that.

471
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,400
We need to continue our usability testing with customers with disabilities

472
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:06,960
Again, someone like me who doesn't ... I don't have a disability per se

473
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,840
I mean I'm wearing glasses, this is my assistive technology.

474
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,000
But I don't have a disability per se so that's very different

475
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,320
for me testing as compared with an actual user

476
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,640
who depends on things who will have a very different experience

477
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,880
And then with regards to the kiosk we've completed and launch them but that's an ongoing thing

478
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,360
we're constantly replacing kiosks and those are you know the software's complete the hardware

479
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,400
is being rolled out as the airport's update their kiosks.

480
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,400
And then of course continuing in person education.

481
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,400
Also, changing the culture that's been another quite difficult thing in the company like ours

482
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,240
to create a culture where we do include everyone.

483
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:00,840
I have had a designer come to me and say but blind people don't come to our website.

484
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,320
Like have you been to the airport lately? Have you seen people with guide dogs and canes boarding planes?

485
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,640
How do you think they got there? Not all of them used someone to book your flight.

486
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Many of them actually booked their own flight.

487
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,560
Okay and we're also looking at the in-flight Wi-Fi and entertainment, because we know that's coming down.

488
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,120
The mobile app. Our mobile app fluctuates

489
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,160
in accessibility. Sometimes it's better,

490
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
then someone will make a change and now

491
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,560
it's a little bit worse but actually it's fairly accessible.

492
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,600
mweb, which is to be our mobile web that we roll out

493
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,960
later on this year

494
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,080
as well as the internal flight attendants app

495
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,960
So you know it's been for me it's been the three plus year journey

496
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,280
from grassroots to very structured remediation

497
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,840
and then program building which is where we are today

498
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:09,760
and it's all sort of to make the skies more friendly or the friendly skies.

# Accessible Meetups
Billy Gregory and Dennis Deacon
March 23, 2018

[Presenter] Thanks very much. Enjoy the show.

[Dennis Deacon]: Notice how he called it a show?

[Laughter]

[Dennis]: Probably because you're here.

[Billy Gregory]: I resemble that remark.

[Dennis]: So, hello everyone. Thank you for attending today's session on accessibility meetups. How many people are currently in an accessibility meetup? Raise your hands ...

[Billy]: Wow!

[Dennis]: We'll do more polling a little bit later.

My name is Dennis Deacon. I'm an accessibility engineer with The Paciello Group.

My name is Billy Gregory. I am the Director of Training for The Paciello Group.

[Dennis]: And what we've decided to do today is basically to share stories of our interactions with our meetups. I run the meetup in Chicago, Illinois in the US ...

[Billy]: ... and I am one of the two co-organizers for a11yTO out of Toronto, Canada.

We do have a deck. We have an URL for this deck. The URL is g o o dot g l forward slash eight seven capital H lowercase n lowercase w uppercase V. This will be repeated at the end of the presentation. I will say this is not going to be a content-heavy presentation deck.It's more going to be myself and and Billy sharing stories of our experience running meetups.

## What are Meetups?
So first off, what are meetups? Does everyone know what a meetup is?

[Billy]: I'd say almost every hand in this room went up when we asked them if they were in one, so ...

[Dennis]: Well ...

[Laughter]

[Dennis]: Depending on the meetup ... I don't know, they drink beer. But, I looked up this definition and it's funny, because I tried to find this definition, I could not find ... I figured Wikipedia, but I couldn't find it. A planned event where like-minded people meet and typically chat over cocktails ... So right there, that concerned me. Who has cocktails? Beer, yes. Whiskey, yes. Cocktails I'm not sure. And listen to a guest speaker. I think that differs from ... I know how I run Chicago. Billy, how would you describe yours?

[Billy]: Yeah, we definitely don't run it like an episode of Mad Men. So I don't think we have cocktails. But we definitely have the guest speakers. we try to keep a lot of communication and make it more of an event, as opposed to just listening to one person. We want people to interact and mix with each other. We definitely want to have a very strong, social aspect to it.

[Dennis]: And it's funny because I think we've tried one social event and we had two people show up, which is why I haven't had great experience with the social aspects of meetups. But I tend to be very awareness and training focused. So I tend to do more presentation style. But I'm trying to bend with that, to mix it up, to keep it fresh. We'll cover that topic a little bit later on in this presentation.

## Where are they?
So where are they today? Today, in North America, there are ... I got to look at my notes, 31 known meetups, accessibility meetups. I say "known" because I'm finding about ...  finding out about new meetups every day. I just found out about one in Oslo yesterday. How many people here are members of North American meetups? Raise your hands. Okay, how about International? Oslo, yes! But I mean, there are meetups, accessibility meetups all over the globe. I mean we have them in India, we have them in Australia, even in New Zealand, although it's not as active as that might have thought. The oldest ... now this is going to get controversial.

[Laughter]

[Dennis]: The oldest accessibility meetup is the Sydney accessibility meetup, which was founded in 2010. The controversy because I've been told I'm wrong within the last two days. But for now I'm going with that. The youngest is one that was just started last month in Dublin, Ireland. The largest, I am proud to say, is the one in Chicago, Illinois, and the smallest, again, just starting last month, is the one in Dublin. The average size for accessibility meetups tends to be about 480 people. Did you have anything to add to that?

[Billy]: No ... I didn't know you had past Toronto, so we'll see how long you stay the largest.

[Laughter]

[Dennis]: Okay, can I say, there is a competitive aspect to this. There's a reason ... it's not just for ego
and stuff like that. It's actually the larger we get, the more attractive we are to sponsors, which means we can have ... offer richer meetups and events.

[Billy]: Absolutely.

So, my question to you ... you didn't actually create or start the Toronto meetup, but how did you get started with it?

[Billy]: So I just ... I didn't create it, Jennison Asuncion actually created the Toronto Accessibility meetup with George Zamfir. I was present at sort of the first meetup, and I was sort of hovering around them like a little fan boy for the first half dozen or so. I actually helped them find the first perfect meetup location, so I've sort of been indirectly involved with their organization since Day One. But I started to stumble into a GAAD event and it was actually the first a11yTO meetup, corresponding to the first ever Global Accessibility Awareness Day. I guess Jennison was just in the launching stuff kind of mood.

[Dennis]: As he does.

[Billy]: Yeah, so he'd launched both of them on the same day. I was there. And then when Jennison quit Canada, I took over for him. But just it back up a little bit about one oldest meetup, we should single out John Croston in the room, who actually ran one of the first accessibility camps and meetup groups in the Washington DC area, so ... John is actually like the Godfather of all of our groups.

[John]: Thank you, sir.

[Billy]: Proper credit.

[Dennis]: The only reason why I did not announce him as being the oldest is because he didn't respond to the survey I sent out just before the event. And of course, I have no memory whatsoever.

So, I started the Chicago meetup out of pure selfishness. At the time, four years ago, I was working for a major airline located in the Chicago area who flies the friendly skies ... say no more. And of course, with airlines, we needed ... we were mandated by the Department of Transportation to be accessible within three years. So I wanted to latch on. I actually wanted to move into UX from front-end development, and I saw that as my bridge. Since then, of course, I've decided to stay in the bridge, because I like that more than anything else. But, I looked around for six months for an accessibility meetup in the Chicago area. And since I couldn't find any, as they say, create it yourself. So, on the day after Christmas, in a shopping outlet mall, while my wife was shopping, I'm in the car, creating the Chicago Meetup on meetup.com. And sort of the rest is history. Been loving it ever since.

## How to start a meetup?
So, how to start and grow an accessibility meetup. I say the first thing you need to do is just do it. If you have no accessibility meetup in your local area, create one. I mean I'm not going to promote meetup.com and they're a great platform, there's other ways to do it. I know John has used Eventbrite. Do it how ever works for you. The advice that we're giving, hopefully I'm not speaking for you, but the advice you're giving has worked for us, and we want to share with everyone, but you'll find that in your area, in your locale, different things work. For instance, in Sydney Australia, they have their meetups in the morning, before work, and that works great for them. I never would have thought of it, but as I learn more about them, that's interesting. The one thing, and John can attest to this, you should be up here ... is that you're going to need help.

[John]: Yes.

[Billy]: You need a team.

[Dennis]: You need a team. You can't do it alone. I did it alone for almost three years and it was a lot of hard work. And I desperately looked for assistance to help based on their areas of strength. I brought on someone who's strong with social media. Now they handle all the social media stuff. I handled ... brought on someone who handles events, who does very well with events. This morning, I introduced a new co-organizer, who's going to bring a wealth of richness to our meetup. So, you just have to have help and it's okay. In fact it engages your membership.

[Billy]: Absolutely that was something we acknowledged pretty early on once we took off. We had this sort of revolving door of co-orgs at a11yTO. One, because people move on. It's impossible to think that somebody can start a meetup and stay with it forever. It's an unrealistic expectation that anyone can donate that much of their life for that long. Because these do take a lot of time. I would estimate I'd probably spend a couple of thousand man-hours a year of my own time, on my own dime, organizing these events. So we added a number of people to our team a while back and actually, now that we have our conference in Toronto as well, which is under a11yTO, Oscar and I, who are the two co-orgs, have actually stopped or stepped back from organizing the monthly events. We hand that over to Lisa Folkerson and Nell Chitty of Toronto and they're doing a fantastic job. They've introduced a whole bunch of ... sort of networking kind of games to keep things fresh.

Like they did accessibility speed dating at one of our events. So it's just like speed networking. So basically every minute or two you would move on to a new person, it's just a way to sort of make the group interact with each other. So, you know, just keeping things fresh. I think we have a game of accessibility "Never have I ever" coming up. Which I mean you can think of the things that you had never seen or whatever when looking at it terribly inaccessible website. So we always try to find new ways of getting the ... forcing the members to interact with each other.

[Dennis]: How many organizers do you need ... to help out? It just depends. I think if you have one it's better than none. We found that on average most meetups have about three total organizers, And I think that, obviously that works. There's some that have seven and there's several that only have one. And I would just say that if you only have one ...

[John]: Get help.

[Dennis]: Get Help. Get that support. How have you gotten the word out about the Toronto meetup?

[Billy]: I think we're pretty lucky in Toronto in that we have a very rich community. There's a lot of developers there and the camp definitely helps get word out about the meetups. And we're just we sort of have this built-in interest in the city. So I mean, we spam a lot on Twitter. We're very, you know, active on social media. We're not afraid to pay that extra $10 to boost a Facebook post or whatever we need to do to get more people out. But we also try to keep the events fresh enough that it brings new people all the time and we're lucky in that we have our core set of regulars that come out all the time, and then we have ... we always see new faces. So about 50% of every meetup is new people, which is pretty awesome. Hopefully they come back.

[Dennis Lembrée]: You mentioned Twitter. I just wanted to say, if your active on Twitter and you have an accessibility meetup or you're looking for one, WebAxe has an access meetup list, a Twiiter list. So, it has a bunch of accessibility meetup twitters on the list. So, if you want to check that out, or let me know if you want to be on that list.

[Billy]: Cool. So for those who couldn't hear Dennis, he said on the WebAxe dot com? Dot org?

[Dennis Lembrée]: Well, on Twitter.

[Billy]: Oh, on Twitter. So Twitter. Follow him, he's got a list of accessibility meetup groups, so you can look there or you can ...

[Dennis]: I'm going to selfishly ask you about ... recently on Twitter, you started adding these graphics.

[Billy]: Yeah ...

[Dennis]: They're very eye catching and I think that's one of the benefits. Can you just tell a little story about ... the insight as to why you went in that direction?

[Billy]: We added a wonderfully talented woman named Nell Chitty to our team. And the first thing she did was say "your social media sucks! I want to do this." So she just started adding all of these graphics, just to make things pop out a little bit. It actually started around the time we did conference, because we needed to sell tickets, in order to afford it. So she started adding all these little graphics and then we just went with it. We were like, you had just take over social media and do what you need to do, this is fantastic. So that's worked out well. Now I think she actually just released like a little, and actual little video, I think for one of our last meetups. So she's, yeah, she's just doing all kinds of great stuff.

[Dennis]: We started ... I'm a Twitterhead, always have been, as long as I've been doing web stuff. And I was doing the social media for the first couple years. I think for me it was more about frequency than quality. Which is why I have someone taking over it now. But basically I use Twitter for everything, for promotion, for awareness, as well as building our membership. I have used, shamelessly, Twitter Advanced Search, to follow, from the meetup account, as many digital professionals in Chicago as I can find. And what I have found is a third of those follow us back, which means now they're getting our promotional tweets and other tweets, and maybe third to a half of those actually joining our meetup. So social media, for us, has been very helpful. Now since that has started, I would say now word-of-mouth is really picking up. I mean people who attend are now telling their co-workers and now I see those co-workers attending the next meetup.

[Billy]: It's great to see things grow organically like that. But yet don't ... the best thing you could probably be is shameless when it comes to promoting and growing and looking for new ways to you know build your following.

[Dennis]: If you think of it, we're all passionate about accessibility. So just evangelize it and have as many other people in your community, meetup community evangelize for you as well.

## Venues

[Billy]: This is always a fun one.

[Dennis]: Venues, Billy ...

[Billy]: Remember what I said, be shameless? Be Shameless. Like if you meet somebody, like when I'm not when I'm at events and I'm meeting people for the first time, I'm like, hey, what brings you out and where you work, how big is the office, have you ever thought about hosting one of these, here's my card, let's go, you know. But honestly, you just ask and that's the easiest way to do it. Everybody that comes out, we put out emails all the time, little tweets, but we actually just ask people face-to-face, where do you work? Would you be interested in hosting something like this? We've got a couple of folks that offer us sort of a standing invite too, but we try to move around as much as possible, just to keep things fresh. It's also a little easier to get people out when your in different areas of the city, because its not always easy to get somebody out across town at 5pm or 6pm. So we try to move from one end of the city as much as we can.

[Dennis]: In Chicago, we started in a bar ... which was fun, except for when we wanted to do any sort of talk or presentation, you couldn't hear. Which is, obviously ... which success criteria is that again? Audio Contrast, I don't know ...

[Laughter]

[Billy]: Did he just invent a new success criteria?

[Dennis]: But luckily enough, after the second event at the bar, we had someone from Razorfish, who said "Hey, I can put you in our conference room, after hours." And, basically, the rest is history after that. We've worked with various groups, individuals and not ... So, one thing I would say is ... even though it's slightly dealing with the devil, sometimes, as you might look at it, look for a recruitment firm. They love to have their talent, UX, developers, and stuff, come in to their organization if they have the facilities, they would be more than happy to host your event. Now, there's pros and cons ... they're going to want to sell ... so you will have to manage that, maybe, depending on the recruitment firm. But that's one way to sort of "get in," if you're having problems.

[Billy]: Schools, dev shops, those little bootcamp ... we have an organization in Toronto called Hacker U.

253
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,100
They offer us their classrooms after hours as well, so there's always opportunities.

254
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,420
You just have to dig a little bit.

255
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,640
You ran out of a library?

256
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,860
[John Croston III]: We ran for the first 4 or 5 years out of a public library.

257
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,280
And now we're at Blackboard, we're there all the time.

258
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,700
[Audience member]: Seattle too.

259
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
[John Croston III]: Seattle is out of a library too.

260
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,960
[Billy]: So libraries are an option, any kind of public space.

261
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,060
[Dennis]: The one thing I will say is, you might feel relieved once you've found a venue,

262
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,220
but please make sure they're accessible.

263
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,400
Go, actually do a scouting and check it out.

264
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,280
Make sure that they offer all the facilities for accessibility.

265
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,500
Make sure they have good audio, visual equipment.

266
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,740
Funny enough, right now, one of our requirements is, we need to have two screens, two monitors.

267
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,560
One for the presentation, one for live captions.

268
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,340
We'll get into it later, but we live stream everything.

269
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,720
So we provide live captioning along with our event.

270
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,460
And yes, of course, good Wi-Fi.

271
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,900
I'm actually finding that that is more difficult than I would have thought.

272
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,020
You want to make sure that, obviously, the presenter needs Wi-Fi.

273
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:23,080
If you're doing something special with live captioning, you might need a separate network for that,

274
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
a good, fast network for that.

275
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,840
And also consider your participants, your attendees,

276
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,340
who might need Wi-Fi, let's say, if they're accessing live captioning from other means.

277
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,620
So, definitely want to look at those as you look at venues for your meetup.

278
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,760
Speakers

279
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
[Billy]: This is a fun one.

280
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,700
So we took a different approach in Toronto last year.

281
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,020
We actually put together a curriculum,

282
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:55,020
and then we started thinking about who would be best to deliver on that specific topic.

283
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:01,980
So we sort of planned our year, decided which topics we wanted, and then sort of approached people on that.

284
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,120
Now there's always going to be someone who's coming through town.

285
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,100
Like if a Lainey Feingold comes through your town, you drop everything and you set up a meetup

286
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,100
because you know you're going to get 200 people out for that.

287
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,960
So, there's the special guest, for the most part, like if Adrian's coming through town,

288
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
that's a good 15 people right there.

289
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,240
[Laughter]

290
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
[Comments from the audience]

291
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,680
So we can book like the public restroom or something for him ...

292
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,720
[Laughter]

293
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,360
But its ... there's always special events that we do.

294
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,160
At Toronto, we're a big social town, we love our social events.

295
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,860
If we book a social event at a bar, on a days notice, we'll fill it.

296
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,560
I guess Canadians just love their beer.

297
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,940
But we're really fortunate ... [indecipherable]

298
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,600
Finding speakers, we approach ... we're shameless ...

299
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:01,520
[Dennis]: It's funny because, actually, two years ago, is when I discovered that,

300
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,500
having well-known speakers, traveling through your city.

301
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,820
Derek Featherstone was the first individual. He was speaking at An Event Apart

302
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,760
I shamelessly just said, "Hey, while you're in town, can you speak at our meetup."

303
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,060
And he said, "Sure."

304
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:25,280
I've had the same thing happen with Lainey. And with Marcy Sutton. It's great.

305
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,460
But it also doesn't stop with in-person speakers.

306
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,400
We've had Laura Kalbag from Sweden present remotely.

307
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:43,260
So, you are in a locale that doesn't get the celebrities if you want to say, coming through town,

308
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,040
always consider going the remote route.

309
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,800
Yes?

310
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:54,960
[Attendee]: Hi, I'm from Dallas, and my friend and I are wanting to start a meetup.

311
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,420
Do speakers expect monetary ... ?

312
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,280
[Billy]: We've never had anyone ask us for money.

313
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,140
I think, most of the time, folks know that if their coming to speak at a small meetup group,

314
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,160
there's not going to be money. Best case, you take them out to dinner afterwards.

315
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,340
[Dennis]: And I have to get good at actually buying them a beer afterwards.

316
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,140
I'm typically the first one out, catching the train.

317
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,960
I need to get better.

318
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,600
So, yes, very good question on that.

319
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,300
I've actually toyed with ... if we got enough sponsorship, maybe there would be some nominal payment.

320
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,600
I think that would be more valuable for our local speakers.

321
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,240
To say, "Thanks for all the effort you put into this."

322
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,700
And then, I think, you know, obviously, you have your celebrity speakers, your local speakers

323
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:55,500
I am very much looking at taking individuals from our meetup

324
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,460
who I know have skills, knowledge and experience,

325
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:05,420
and trying to encourage them, almost mentoring them to speak at our meetups.

326
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,120
Just this year, I have already picked out four individuals who I've said, "I want you to work on something."

327
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,900
"I want you to work on something for later this year."

328
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:23,860
Because I think it does resonate well with the attendees, that someone in their midst, look what they're doing.

329
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:30,300
And that might actually create more connections and networking opportunities for that speaker,

330
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,320
to share their knowledge.

331
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Ok, Formats.

332
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,300
[Billy]: These are fun.

333
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,960
We have a few different formats in Toronto.

334
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,120
We generally stick with either a social event, so there is no speaker whatsoever,

335
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,020
we just take over a top floor of a pub, and we just network and socialize,

336
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,120
we have our one speaker-type meetup, where they come and present on something,

337
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,040
and then, interestingly enough, our two biggest events of the year, I don't now why,

338
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,160
the two biggest events that we always have is,

339
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,320
we always kick off the year with sort of an introductory, sort of accessibility 101 panel,

340
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,860
that's always rammed.

341
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,060
And then for some reason, the week after CSUN, we usually do a CSUN wrap-up.

342
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,160
And that was always rammed as well. And those are general panels.

343
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,400
And then literally anything with the letters UX in it.

344
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,480
[Dennis]: Yeah, what is it with UX?

345
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,480
[Billy]: I don't know.

346
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:35,720
[Dennis]: It's funny. Presentations have worked well for us.

347
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:43,140
Because I have a sort of training and awareness mindset, that's the direction I've normally gone in.

348
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,920
But I am looking, and we're talking about keeping it fresh in a little bit here,

349
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
we are looking to mix it up.

350
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,760
I know for Global Accessibility Awareness Day, to your point, having a speed dating format,

351
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:04,640
we're looking at having an empathy event, where we'll have groups of individuals with various disabilities

352
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:12,720
and groups of attendees will visit these stations, the verbiage here is off the top of my head,

353
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
we haven't fully planned it out yet.

354
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:21,340
But basically, attendees would interact with individuals with disabilities

355
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:30,140
and learn about how their work, their thinking impacts those individuals.

356
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,400
And after ten, fifteen minutes, whistle blows, people switch stations.

357
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,620
And, there's been a lot of excitement within our organizers of this event.

358
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,620
So, I'm looking to see how that plays out.

359
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,380
[Billy]: That sounds good.

360
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,260
[Dennis]: Demonstrations I have down here.

361
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,180
I know next month, we're looking ...

362
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:57,360
So, screen readers are actually very popular, but most people are not aware of other assistive technology.

363
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,260
So we're having an event where, we're doing two different demos.

364
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:09,180
One of them is for refreshable braille display, which most of our membership is completely unaware of.

365
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,480
But then, hopefully this works out,

366
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:20,880
we're having someone come in and to discuss assistive technology for individuals with cognitive disabilities.

367
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:29,380
Jamie Knight said he would remote in, and now he's talking he might actually be in town

368
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,020
I'm like, "you gotta be kidding me."

369
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:42,640
So I'm trying to keep my enthusiasm down, because if that all comes about, I will be a kid in a candy store.

370
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,080
[Billy]: Oh yeah, and so, in an other life, I used to promote professional wrestling shows.

371
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,620
[Dennis]: which feeds into this perfectly.

372
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,740
[Laughter]

373
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,120
[Billy]: You can snicker, but the logic behind this is,

374
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,340
on the pro wrestling circuit, if you have a big name wrestler, and you wanted to bring them to your event,

375
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:07,620
what you would do is find other promoters in cities close by, and you would share in that initial travel cost.

376
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:14,720
So, you get four or five meetups that are close together, and then you can pay the cost of flights or whatever

377
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,200
to bring this person over. So that's another option; if you know someone coming through town,

378
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,460
if Jamie was coming to Chicago, then I might think about flying him up to Toronto,

379
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,520
because it's only an hour or so by plane, we could split some of the costs or whatever.

380
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,620
So, there's always options to sort of share, split costs between sister cities

381
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,920
If you're running in Dallas, I know that Austin has a group, which isn't that far away.

382
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,220
[Dennis]: Sponsors

383
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,040
I might just look straight to you and find out how you do sponsors.

384
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,740
[Billy]: Be Shameless.

385
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,620
[Laughter]

386
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,700
[Dennis]: Again

387
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,320
[Billy]: Literally, I am just ruthless when it comes to begging for money.

388
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,900
I call in every favor. Anybody I ask, they get added to our meetup mailing list.

389
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,280
Johnny Taylor, you've probably seen him in a couple of slide decks this week, in my talk, in Heni's talk,

390
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,540
he actually looks after a lot of our sponsorship stuff.

391
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,560
So he's the guy, just at home, spamming people ...

392
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,260
and it's not spam, these are personal, boilerplate emails that we send out to everybody.

393
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,280
It's got everyone's name on it, not just [name] in brackets or anything.

394
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:30,360
But we're pretty ruthless about it. We call in favors.

395
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,060
We have sort of an attractive tiered sponsorship.

396
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,440
And that's one thing that worked well for us. We introduced sponsorship tiers a couple of years ago.

397
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,060
Just as a ... maybe it would work.

398
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:46,300
And people loved it. The sponsors saw more value in that,

399
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,840
because they got more space, there was more perks,

400
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,820
we added different value options or value adds as you went up a level.

401
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,220
And we run pretty big events.

402
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,900
On average, get about 60 or 70 people out for each meetup that we have host.

403
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,900
Socials are about 50 to 60.

404
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,140
We have a yearly camp that we bring, well, we ...

405
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:18,240
300 people and this we'll tell you in a slide later,  300 people signup but 200 people show.

406
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,420
No shows are something you'll just need to deal with when you're running a meetup group.

407
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,080
And then now we have conference too.

408
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,660
So we sort of introduced, instead of "hey sponsor this event' or "sponsor camp,"

409
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,880
we have "sponsor a11yTO for the year, and you're going to get all of this.

410
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,740
If you're interested in sponsorship opportunities ...

411
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,200
[Laughter]

412
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,940
[Billy]: you can talk to me after the event.

413
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,900
[Dennis]: Shameless plug

414
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,720
[Billy]: I'm more than happy to discuss sponsorship with any of you.

415
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,000
Except you.

416
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,880
[Laughter]

417
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,540
[Billy]: Question?

418
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:55,480
[Attendee]: A coupe of things that have worked very well, one ties back to the venue.

419
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:04,200
My agency hosts the Detroit UX Meetup ... [indecipherable]

420
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
[Dennis]: Im going to do this ...

421
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,540
[Billy]: I was hoping you'd just lean in.

422
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,780
[Laughter]

423
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:19,660
[Attendee]: So, I am a member of Accessibility Meetup groups and the Detroit UX meetup group...

424
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:25,860
... and when host, when my agency hosts meetups, the agency itself offers swag,

425
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,240
so there's cool stuff sitting around for people to have.

426
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:39,440
The really valuable one though is O'Reilly Publishers and Rosenfeld Media both have user group chapters,

427
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,860
that they provide free books for.

428
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,980
So you can get e-books and physical books to give away at events.

429
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,940
[Dennis]: Actually, that's a good point.

430
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,740
I have done that with A Book Apart as well.

431
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,940
Rosenfeld Media is one of our sponsors and they offer us a discount,

432
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,540
as well as books, free books for special occasions.

433
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,860
The only thing I am going to say about sponsors is ...

434
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:15,380
we're planning ... we're working on a day-long accessibility camp in Chicago for the first time this year.

435
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:15,880
[Billy]: Whoo!

436
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,880
[Applause]

437
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,380
But, and I am not a sponsor ... unlike Billy, I am not one to go out there and say "please give us money."

438
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,380
But, I personally feel, if you can show the benefit and the value to the sponsor,

439
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,560
it's easier than you may think.

440
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,100
So, just consider and think about that.

441
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:45,640
Yes, and wait one moment, I just want to make sure you can be heard by everyone.

442
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,980
Audience member]: So, both of you talked about providing value to the sponsors,

443
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,980
and sponsorship tiers, Billy.

444
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:01,120
Can you be more specific about the kinds of benefits that you offer to sponsors?

445
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:08,680
[Billy]: Yes, so, as a small meetup site, camp, conference, whatever, we don't have a lot to offer,

446
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,000
other than, visibility.

447
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,380
So, certain levels of sponsorship might get you on all of our printed materials that we hand out.

448
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,660
It would be on our website.

449
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,580
Social media callouts.

450
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,520
The frequency and number. Whether or not you have access to our database afterwards.

451
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,560
Not to ... no to, we never give away our information.

452
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,340
But we will include a message from a sponsor in a wrap-up email or something.

453
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:37,600
We will never allow the sponsors direct access to our members, because that's just gross.

454
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,760
But we will definitely pass along any messages.

455
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,980
So its really just, figure out what value you can offer them,

456
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,560
and then just multiply that offering by how ever many tiers you want to give up.

457
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,420
[Dennis]: Exactly.

458
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:58,640
We have 5 more minutes. So ... I'm sorry, one more question, and then we have to move on.

459
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,980
[Audience member]: I want to know about, how often to you communicate via email with your membership,

460
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,980
and what types of email you send out?

461
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,980
[Billy]: Ah, daily. No, just kidding ...

462
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,880
[Laughter]

463
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,940
[Billy]: I sent four emails since I've been up here. Just checking in. How's your day? You know ...

464
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,620
You miss me?

465
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:29,180
No, usually we use it just for announcing events, or, we use social media a lot.

466
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,900
Like, social media, we'll just tweet things that we find interesting, or retweet things.

467
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,020
As far as announcing meetups, we try to keep that to just one or two.

468
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,500
A lot of the time, before wait-list only or something, we might send out another email,

469
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,860
just saying, "hey, if you can't make it now, maybe you should think about changing your RSVPs,

470
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,860
so somebody else can get your spot."

471
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,300
It's kind of a ...

472
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:56,320
not so secret, secret in Toronto that, if the event's full, just show up, because we don't take attendance,

473
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:02,040
we don't check anyone off, and there's always more than enough no-shows that you can sneak in.

474
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,800
[John Croston III] As long as you get by security.

475
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,040
[Billy]: We have no security.

476
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,740
[John Croston III] ... we need four forms ...

477
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,060
[Billy]: Well this isn't your talk, John.

478
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,440
[Laughter]

479
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,080
[Dennis]: But to that point, in Chicago, most of the venues that we use, require building security.

480
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,480
So we have a two-day lead time for cutoffs.

481
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,480
So anyone that says, "Hey, I just noticed ..."

482
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,440
I have to say, I'm sorry. I mean, if you can get through building security, that's on you.

483
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,240
[Billy]: Challenge accepted!

484
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,740
[Dennis]: But guess what ... people have done it. Oh ... need to talk about building security.

485
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,340
We need to move forward ...

486
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,880
To Stream or Not to Stream

487
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,020
Billy, that is the question.

488
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,320
[Billy]: We do not stream. We've dabbled with it.

489
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:56,940
We've had minimal success. And we just don't have the technology at hand to do it in a reliable way.

490
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,560
We do have live captioning for all of our events. So if you're there, you can follow captions.

491
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,380
But we tend to steer away from sharing the content outside of the event.

492
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,180
So there are sort of special one off events and then they're just gone.

493
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,040
So we never made the decision not to stream.

494
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,280
[Dennis]: We live stream almost all of our events.

495
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:24,340
And of course, the question at each time, when we only get 30, 40 percent attendance is ...

496
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,020
is it the stream that's doing it?

497
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:34,700
I actually ran a test recently with an accessibility clinic format, where there was no live stream.

498
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,960
And no recording.

499
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,600
And it did not impact attendance at all.

500
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,120
So I was like, "Ok, cool."

501
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,100
I tend to want to live stream because I want to create awareness.

502
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,100
I mean, some of our sponsorship has been due to, getting that word out.

503
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,240
So, I don't wish to hurt that.

504
00:36:52,240 --> 00:37:00,660
I do know that a lot of other accessibility organizers feel that it can cannibalize their in-person attendance

505
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,160
as well as they want that face-to-face recognition.

506
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,400
So it really just depends on your scenario, what you like to do.

507
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,800
Live captioning and American Sign Language

508
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,780
[Billy]: Yes.

509
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,260
If you are running an inclusive event, you need this. It's the bottom line.

510
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:25,240
ASL, we have on request. If somebody says I need this, we'll have it.

511
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,040
We try to find discreet ways of asking, if somebody needs it.

512
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,940
At our Camps and at our Conference, it's just there. We don't ask anybody if they need it, it's just there.

513
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,680
And live captioning is without a doubt, 100 percent always going to be there.

514
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,840
Because you can't have an inclusive event if it's not inclusive.

515
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,180
[Dennis]: Same here, if I couldn't offer live captioning I probably wouldn't live stream that event.

516
00:37:52,940 --> 00:38:02,260
For special events, especially for those where participants would be hard of hearing or deaf,

517
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,780
we do have sign language interpreters there.

518
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Again, its all about budget, it's all making sure you can cover it with your sponsorships.

519
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Keeping it fresh.

520
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,280
I think I already mentioned how I'm looking into it. Anything you'd like to add to that?

521
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,140
[Billy]: Yeah, so one interesting challenge we had was somebody said,

522
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,840
and I'm tipping my hat here, so this is just between us and Twitter, ok?

523
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,820
We're introducing something new in Toronto coming up.

524
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,460
Because we had a bunch of business folks, we call them the train crowd,

525
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,960
that basically have to get out of the city at 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock

526
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,840
They've got kids, they've got families, they can't stick around for a meetup.

527
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,340
So, we had somebody suggest, "well, why can't you do something during the day?"

528
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,660
So we are introducing something that is geared more towards corporate clients or people who can't get out,

529
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,220
and we are introducing what we are going to be calling the lunch meet.

530
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,220
I think it's a very funny name. Oskar Westin came up with that.

531
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:08,720
But a11yTO is going to start running lunch hour meetups at organizations, and we're going to stream those

532
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,140
for everybody else who can't make it. So that's something we're going to be doing probably in May.

533
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,480
[Dennis]: Ok, hold on. I gotta write that down.

534
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,260
[Billy]: Don't worry, I'll schedule it. don't worry.

535
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,680
[Dennis]: That's fantastic.

536
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,680
I can't really add anything to that. I told you, we're looking at speed dating formats.

537
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,140
It's basically as ideas come about. The speed dating format came from Twitter.

538
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:38,380
[Billy]: I think it came from the guy beside you. Doesn't that sound familiar?

539
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,320
[Dennis faux whispering to Billy]

540
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,820
[Dennis]: Attendance

541
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,440
I think we, I mean, it's just a pain point.

542
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,420
Oversell. I used to work for an airline. It works. Fill up planes, fill up your meetup.

543
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,580
This is hard to see because it's not actually meant as information,

544
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:03,660
but this was a meetup that Marcy Sutton presented at.

545
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,640
We had one hundred twenty seven RSVPs.

546
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
We had thirty three people show up.

547
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,240
And that's normal.

548
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,160
[Billy]: Yeah, that's not uncommon to have ... fifty percent drop off is normal.

549
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:23,980
And, it's not uncommon to have a butt ton of people say, yeah I want to come out and then have a handful.

550
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,340
I mean, life happens, right?

551
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,080
It's at night, anything can happen.

552
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,140
You might be stuck late at work. You might have a problem with your children.

553
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:35,800
You might just say ... [indecipherable] ... oh, it's my hair, sorry.

554
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:42,400
[Dennis]: We're actually over, but you got time for one story, and I have time for one story.

555
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,800
[Billy]: Geez, why don't you do your story first, I have too many stories.

556
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,140
[Dennis]: As ... starting with the ...

557
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,620
meetup events, I've always looked for them to be as accessible as possible.

558
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:03,860
In doing so, if you are more able bodied than others, you're going to make mistakes.

559
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,860
And you'll learn from those mistakes.

560
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:13,660
We had events where I dimmed the lights, so this way, the screen could be seen better.

561
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,200
Unfortunately, the individuals who were hard of hearing or deaf

562
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,080
could not read lips when we did not have captions.

563
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,420
That was a great bit of information. But I felt awful.

564
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:36,100
Same thing happened for one of our events, we had a live stream going, we went over, I shut down the stream,

565
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,180
the individual next to me was going "hey, what happened to the stream?"

566
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,260
He was looking at live captions. I said ah, crap.

567
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,100
So it took me about five more minutes to get it connected.

568
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,940
Anything?

569
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,300
[Billy]: I've definitely had the same pain points you've had.

570
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,240
But I want to build off this.

571
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,120
I think ...

572
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,760
one of the fun things you can do with these events is to look for others ways to engage the community.

573
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:04,560
So, find another thing that might tie in to your overall message, and find a new, fun way to present it.

574
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:10,460
We had a professional wrestler at ... I'm mixing my worlds here now ...

575
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,820
but we had a professional wrestler at our last camp, who had been bullied all his life, because he is a little person.

576
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,280
And he found that by putting on a mask and being a wrestler,

577
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,020
it was his way of combating basically his disability.

578
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,140
So he came and did a little talk about that, and then the best part was,

579
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,200
he put Jennison Asuncion on his shoulders and did ten squats.

580
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,200
[Laughter]

581
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,280
[Billy]: That was fun. Oh and then he threw him down to the ground and pinned him.

582
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,660
Jennison is no longer the champion of accessibility, It's a young man named Kid Canuck from Toronto, Ontario.

583
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:51,400
[Dennis]: Just before we wrap up, if you jotted down the URL for this deck, we have a few resources.

584
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,320
One is a list of accessibility and inclusive design meetup groups,

585
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:03,800
which is regularly maintained by an individual in Detroit Michigan, so you might want to check that one out.

586
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,540
I recently did an accessibility meetup survey for organizers.

587
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:15,340
So basically a lot of the same information that we shared today is there in this one page report.

588
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:22,520
And then the last three are documents that my meetup has created as far as

589
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:29,200
a venues checklist for accessibility, accessible presentations guide for presenters,

590
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:35,760
how to create accessible presentations, how to ensure you're repeating the questions, things like that,

591
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:42,720
and then social media, basically how to create accessible tweets and such.

592
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,700
With that said, we thank you for attending.

593
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,460
[Applause]

# Cultural Accessibility at the MCA Chicago
## Anna Chiaretta Lavatelli, Susan Chun and Sina Bahram - Thursday, January 28, 2016
[Source recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxdwxwdxSVo)

1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,500
[Sina]: So, I can go over a couple of things.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:19,600
So, we started working together because the MCA was launching a new website.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,840
And so the new website had a lot of, as these projects do,  goals, some of them competing

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,140
some of them aligning, and accessibility was one of the goals there.

5
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,440
And so we started talking very early. The reason I'm pointing this out is because

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,700
that doesn't often happen, so for those of you who are in the accessibility space,

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,700
you'll know a couple of different recipes, one of them is, "we launched two years ago

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,180
and we should really get on that, so, yeah, what are your thoughts on our website?"

9
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:00,180
Others are "Yeah, we totally know that it is inaccessible, but we don't have the funds to deal with it" and et cetera

10
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,100
And yet others are "Oh yeah, we're going to be really great. We're definitely going to involve accessibility

11
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,460
and usability and all that stuff like that," about one week before launch. Sounds like a good plan.

12
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:21,320
So that's some of the things that often happen in this space. And lead to less than optimal results, right?

13
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,460
because it's the architecture model. If you think about it at the end, after a family has been living in the house

14
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,940
adding a room is very expensive.

15
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,540
But if you think about it at the blueprint phase,  it costs a little extra money maybe,

16
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:39,100
but you're talking to the architect, your tearing down walls, redrawing lines, things like that.

17
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,260
Same with accessibility. Started working with these guys on accessibility, of the website

18
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,180
and we have some thoughts to share with you on that.

19
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:55,340
One of the consequences of doing accessibility on a museum website, actually an art museum,

20
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,200
is that there's art. And so this art is on the web. And now we have an issue.

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,860
We can't just say, images don't have alt text. 
That's not a one-liner anymore.

22
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,300
You can have ten thousand images, all of a sudden, that's a really big commitment.

23
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,320
You can't just slip that one by. So we really started to have these serious discussion about

24
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,100
images needing to be described and what does that even mean?

25
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,200
What about if it's art? Yeah, ok, we have some very good standards for describing an infographic like a pie chart

26
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,700
but what does it mean to describe a work of art? And what about different authors having different opinions

27
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:39,740
and biases and so on and so forth. And this lead to the creation of a tool here at the MCA called Coyote.

28
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:46,740
Coyote is nothing more than a web application. It's a web-based application, that happens to be accessible.

29
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:53,600
Which is a little ironic given what is does. What is does is the workflow management for describing images.

30
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,420
So, if you have a lot of images, which the MCA does, assigning descriptions to that

31
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,540
is a lot harder than just a field in WordPress or a field in Drupal for example.

32
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,540
because there are different languages perhaps, there are short descriptions and long descriptions

33
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,480
there are multiple descriptions for a single photo, or the opposite of that problem, the same image

34
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,380
being used in different ways, across the website. In this case, it's just a thumbnail for the restaurant,

35
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,260
but over here, it's the actual focus, it's the featured image for the restaurant page.

36
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,060
Those might have different meanings. The other thing is that, some of you might be thinking

37
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,140
well, when it's used as an icon or a link or button, that's really important for, let's say blind users

38
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,840
but , what's the point in describing it in other senses. Then it's just decorative.

39
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,880
We hear this word a lot in accessibility with respect to decorative images.

40
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,440
But because it's such a part of the institution, and I'm speaking a little bit for you here,

41
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:58,060
because it's such a core part of the institution, and the aesthetic, the information content,

42
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:05,120
the actual meaning behind the work that's done here, Susan and Anna rightfully felt that

43
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,140
that this needs to be really well described, this needs to be part of the core tenons

44
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,840
of the usability model of somebody coming to the website.

45
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,040
So, what we started doing was started putting these descriptions into Coyote

46
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,560
and I think I'll let these guys talk about that a little bit, then what I was thinking was

47
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,420
we can project if we want to, but honestly, I got a speaker set up here, we can get some good volume

48
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,460
I'm happy to let a screen reader read you guys some descriptions, I think there are some sample descriptions

49
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:39,200
as well and you can visit the website on your own device of course as well, which would be fine, if you need

50
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,040
to use a particular AT, a particular assistive technology to interact with it.

51
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,440
But maybe before we do that, I want to talk just a little about, the effect of description

52
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,300
with respect to the curation staff and the awesome, different organizations that got involved.

53
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:03,580
[Susan] Yeah, so as Sina was saying, the task of describing ten thousand images

54
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:09,900
and doing that on an anomaly basis, and then addressing the backlog of images

55
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:16,980
is a pretty daunting one. Just to give you context, really, this is something that as far as we know,

56
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,120
no art museum in this country has taken on and committed to.

57
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:30,780
There are projects, in gallery projects, or mobile projects that are accessible

58
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,060
and for which images have been described.

59
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,400
but nothing on the sort of systematic scale, and so it wasn't as if we were going to be totally

60
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,740
on the hook if we didn't do this. Which actually makes this a little bit harder.

61
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:51,960
There were some, you know, if the law were pounding down our door, we could sell it.

62
00:05:51,960 --> 00:06:01,500
As it is, we were obliged to think about a couple of things. One was selling it to colleagues

63
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,000
from throughout the museum. It was pretty clear to me from the very beginning.

64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,920
Sina and I actually disagreed about this, I now recall.

65
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,240
When we were first talking about who would do the description, I think that we thought it needed

66
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,460
Sina thought it needed to be done within, my, which is publishing, media,

67
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,900
that people who had a certain set of skills would be best to do this.

68
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,540
And unlike cataloging, I mean I'm a cataloging professional, so I think about those things too.

69
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,700
But it didn't seem to me even remotely possible that it could scale. I mean we're just not a big enough group.

70
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,820
And so we snuck around Sina, and a

71
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,580
[Laughter]

72
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,640
[Sina] I totally forgot that you did that.

73
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,060
[Laughter]

74
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,620
[Susan] No, but that first meeting that we had, that big room full of people,

75
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,460
we kept telling people "be quiet"

76
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,480
[Laughter]

77
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,080
[Anna] Well, no. There was this hilarious  ... we talked about it was going to be five people,

78
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,980
it was actually this room full of people. There was this moment when you asked "can you hear me?"

79
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,660
And everybody said "Yes!"

80
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,320
[Laughter]

81
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,500
And Sina was like "oh no."

82
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,820
[Laughter]

83
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,020
[Susan] But it was scary because I'm afraid of Sina.

84
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,220
[Laughter]

85
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,060
[Susan] Also, that find to see how many people. We sent out an email

86
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:28,580
to the staff, and to staff from all other, not just professionals who were involved in creating content

87
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,840
but also visitor services, human resources, a lot of different folks

88
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,540
who we thought would be good candidates for doing this work. And the response was really really robust.

89
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:45,080
We were asking people to come on their own time, lunch time, and they did.

90
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,720
So that was pretty exciting.

91
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,960
From our point of view, this is the only way this will sustain this.

92
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:03,680
Otto was saying earlier in a meeting today that we did our first writing sessions as a group

93
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:11,260
because this is not a natural thing necessarily to do. But what we've imagined in our heads

94
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:17,260
is that this is the kind of thing that folks would ... on a really boring conference call ...

95
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,020
[Laughter]

96
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,260
... on their lunch hour, if they have a little extra flex to it, they would do that.

97
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,020
So we built the tool to be something that people could sign in to from where ever, whenever.

98
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:43,220
We had training, from Sina, for a couple of sessions. And the training consisted of a little bit of guideline setting

99
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,160
Some basic information about the difference between alt and a long description.

100
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,900
But more than anything, a lot of questions that our folks asked, that don't necessarily come up

101
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:01,120
like in other contexts. Is a picture of Adam and Eve fleeing the Garden of Eden

102
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:09,660
just two naked people running, or is it actually Adam and Eve, how much knowledge do you assume people have

103
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,040
really good questions that I have to say, I've said this a lot today, we don't have answers to.

104
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,740
We're really just beginning to compile questions and beginning to think about,

105
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:27,100
how institutions and individuals address those. But the group nature of thinking together about

106
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,860
description, what is valuable, what works, what is comfortable to do

107
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,540
what are valuable descriptions to end users, that's a piece we need to tackle next,

108
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,240
is sort of in our sights.

109
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,960
[Sina] You have the right groups. So the number of descriptions that these guys have been able to pull off

110
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,640
is ... it started after the first three, four hundred?

111
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,680
[Anna] Yeah.

112
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,780
[Sina] And it is over one thousand now?

113
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,780
[Anna] Actually what was amazing, yeah, it's well over one thousand now.

114
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:05,260
What was amazing was, adding the counter, one of the features I asked Sina to incorporate into the software

115
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,480
was a counter, so you could see how many descriptions were in there. How many images were described.

116
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,160
To encourage people to keep going.

117
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,440
[Susan] There was even some game theory in there.

118
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,280
[Anna] Some departments wanted it to become competitive, so there's a counter.

119
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,680
And so once the counter was active, we had another Coyote group writing session.

120
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,840
We had laptops set up in this room again, set up around the room and everyone was writing in pairs

121
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:37,000
And I was just refreshing the homepage of Coyote every fifteen minutes and watching the number go up

122
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,060
And in an hour we went from three or four hundred to over a thousand.

123
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,500
And now we're over a thousand and counting

124
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,700
[Susan] Of which a very large number are unreviewed because

125
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,120
the people who are supposed to be reviewing are

126
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,400
[Sina] sitting on either side of me.

127
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,420
[Laughter]

128
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,560
[Sina] But that does bring up a good point about the review process.

129
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,600
So I mentioned workflow earlier, but kind of casually and didn't define it.

130
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,320
So this idea of putting descriptions on images is one thing. Having it really be,

131
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,400
again, going back to having accessibility live, I've said this a couple times today,

132
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,800
having accessibility live as a first class citizen, as part of projects here, projects plural,

133
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,480
means that these descriptions get edited, content matters.

134
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,680
I've seen a lot of upsides, I'm sure you guys have too.

135
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:35,940
My most favorite is accessibility being misspelled. Usually there's a "C" or an "S" missing.

136
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:43,460
And screen readers say it funny. Which is ironic. But that's part of the process here.

137
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,520
Susan just ... the amount of passion and care that goes into digital media here

138
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,840
also goes into the accessibility quality. The quality of the content for accessibility.

139
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,620
And the descriptions, actually do you have one? 
Do you want to read?

140
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:06,740
I can have a screen reader do this as well, and you can go to mcachicago.org and a lot of the graphics there are

141
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,360
Oh one quick note, for the folks familiar with short and long description.

142
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,280
Right now,  just for now, and I will explain why I am saying this in a second,

143
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,900
the long descriptions, the lengthier ones if you will, they are stored as the alt text of the image.

144
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:28,080
Yes, we definitely know that alt text is traditionally done ... 120, 200 characters or less,

145
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:34,980
but the reason we did that was for maximum compatibility, and then later on, in future cycles

146
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,380
and iterations of the development cycle for the website, we're actually going to roll out ...

147
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,560
I can talk about that, right?

148
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,360
[Susan] Yes, of course.

149
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,860
[Sina] We're going to roll out a feature whereby we're making visible,

150
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,160
and I mean that in every sense of the word, not only to screen reader users

151
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:59,140
but also to every user who can see, and what not, the long descriptions and the short descriptions

152
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,300
of these images. And the reason that matters is because of something that Susan always brings up,

153
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,520
which is when you start talking to people about this stuff and start talking to them about describing it,

154
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,220
or whether, just the fact that the stuff exists, say "Oh, I want to see that."

155
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,100
and right now it's mainly accessible to using the screen reader, or if you check some things in your browser

156
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,680
but we want to make sure that is exposed to all users accessibly, so sure it will be

157
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,100
some short descriptions, an alt and a nice widget to expose the longer descriptions for keyboard users

158
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:34,720
but for mouse users and everybody as well so that everybody can benefit from those descriptions.

159
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:42,860
[Anna] Because, ostensibly its close viewing of an artwork, and that's been

160
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,840
the most exciting part, it opens up these artworks.

161
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:53,480
So, I'm going to read a description written by a curator at the MCA of a painting.

162
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,720
I will perhaps show it and you can decide.

163
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,040
[Laughter]

164
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,600
[Anna] and this is a long description.

165
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,600
This painting, a realistic portrait, depicts a young African-American woman in a stylish orange coat.

166
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,480
In the lower right corner of the image, she holds a thin paint brush in her hand,

167
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,180
alongside a flat palette covered in thicks dabs of paint in a variety of colors.

168
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,760
The square composition centers on her face and upper body and she looks directly out at the viewer

169
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:28,480
with a calm but commanding gaze. At first, the dark black hue of her skin almost blends in

170
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,060
with the black wall that is directly behind her on the left. But her dark complexion also contrasts

171
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,020
with the white background of a partially finished painting that appears behind her on the right.

172
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,360
Gradually it becomes evident that she is painting a self portrait using a paint by numbers system.

173
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,640
On the easel beside her, the figure's face and body are divided up into smaller shapes,

174
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,380
each one outlined in light blue. She has filled in a few of them already with bright orange

175
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,460
or mint green from her palette, but she isn't strictly following actual colors of her own appearance.

176
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:12,320
[Susan] So, Anna said that a curator wrote that, I think that was, oh, sorry, microphone. I think it was interesting

177
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,140
about this is that, that isn't ... though it was written by a curator, that's not actually how our curators write.

178
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,800
[Anna] Not at all.

179
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:28,780
[Susan] Before I came here, I worked at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and we had a phrase that we used

180
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:38,180
and it always said disabling, which was that, what you, this is a terrible terrible text, it's art history for the blind.

181
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,980
[Laughter]

182
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:47,300
[Susan] It said exactly that. The sky is blue, the grass is green, the pretty girl is lying on the beach,

183
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:56,260
it was purely descriptive and that was considered to be somehow lesser

184
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,120
because it wasn't interpretive, it wasn't scholarly and it didn't contain research

185
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,340
[Sina] As opposed to something which I might call rather useless from a vision point of view

186
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:11,120
which is that we can experience a rich plethora of colors the artists youthful age.

187
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,620
[Laughter]

188
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,080
[Susan] But I understand that person who wrote this would have been raised to disdain art,

189
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:26,600
his grief for the blind, just that kind of description, and he has been one of our most enthusiastic participants

190
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:34,820
because he has found in doing this some value for his practice that has ...

191
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:42,860
enforcing him to empathize with the point of view of somebody who doesn't come to works of art

192
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,200
with knowledge that has been gained over years and years and years of study

193
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:55,280
and it's been really exciting to watch him sort of raise the idea that there are things to be said

194
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:04,160
in simple description of the sort that might actually be as valuable as the writing that he does

195
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:15,120
that takes five years of research. So we're really excited about how this work is done and that it's

196
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,780
something that is going to bring value to our users and our visitors, but it's also really helping our staff

197
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:26,100
to think about what we do and why.

198
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,660
[Sina] And not only to help the staff but to help someone who, has great twenty-twenty vision

199
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:40,960
and can see the painting just fine. And I read the description and say you know, I never noticed X, Y and Z

200
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,980
I never actually picked up on X, Y, and Z and that is a really enriching experience not only for

201
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,000
someone who might be experiencing it for the first time, but there's this, in the gaming world

202
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,600
you would call it replay value, right? So there's this quality though

203
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:05,040
of using accessibility and inclusive design to increase the replay value of visiting an art museum

204
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,600
and experiencing these works of art. Yeah sure, you can still see it again and

205
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,120
you might get something different out of it of course because that's one of the essences of art

206
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:21,340
but having this description almost repositions you to appreciate that visual information

207
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,120
even if you can see in a different way.

208
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,700
[Susan] This is part of the reason why when we built Coyote, it was important for us to allow

209
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:35,640
for multiple description. Which again is one of those, it's kind of sacrilegious, in this institution.

210
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,880
There should be a kind of...

211
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,420
[Sina] Thing

212
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,940
[Susan] Absolutely, the right description. I don't believe in that. But it's really difficult

213
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:54,020
to change a culture that sort of strives for an absolute perfect.

214
00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:01,680
and we are ... so this is one of the reasons, by the way, I realize that it sounds really icky,

215
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,060
that I was saying we had to have these things, they have to be edited, there can't be subject and predicates

216
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:12,220
because Sina suggested that we could do without verbs ... and articles.

217
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,800
[Anna] No it was articles.

218
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:20,500
[Susan] No, yeah, okay, definitely not verbs. Also without articles.

219
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,340
But ...

220
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,040
[Sina] For short, just to be clear.

221
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,920
[Laughter]

222
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,180
[Susan] Part of ... yes, for short descriptions. Very well. Part of the reason why we're

223
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:41,620
being a little bit cautious about the editorial pieces is that I'm a little afraid that we're just beginning to

224
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:48,060
tip the culture again toward, it's okay for visitor services staff to describe something because they spent

225
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:54,360
all of this time talking to visitors and trying to understand what they want to know, what they don't see

226
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,260
this is the type of interaction that curators don't have so they bring that experience to the description

227
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:09,060
it's pretty exciting to see the ways that the different members of the MCA team are learning from each other

228
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:17,580
about our interaction with the public. That was an unexpected side effect of this whole process.

229
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,040
[Sina] I think we want to phrase this a little bit more as a discussion, without raising your hand

230
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,600
because that's useless for me, but ... any questions?

231
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,440
[Susan] Could you just tap your hand

232
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,540
[Laughter]

233
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,280
[Sina] Or just speak up ... so many burning questions. But any questions

234
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,100
or comments on stuff that we discussed so far?

235
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:46,140
I'm totally commandeering ... you guys ok with that?

236
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,580
[Susan] Yeah

237
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,920
[Anna] Of course

238
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,920
[Sina] I'm being arbitrary, you spoke up first, in the front, to my right

239
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:02,400
[Renee] Have any of your artists objected to defining, describing their work?

240
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,060
My daughter's a choreographer and she will not say what it means

241
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:14,860
[Susan] We recently published a little factoid about the number of works in our collection

242
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,060
that have the title of "untitled" and its a very significant number

243
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,440
[Anna] Twenty one percent

244
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,480
[Sina] Wow!

245
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,600
[Anna Laughing] Contemporary art

246
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:31,720
[Susan] And we published alongside sort of a note that artists will frequently title something untitled

247
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:39,260
so as to allow for interpretation on the part of the viewer, so yeah that's one reason why artists may object to...

248
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,940
[Renee] that was my point

249
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:48,040
[Susan] yes, but the other reason is we might frankly be wrong. We haven't heard it yet

250
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:55,740
but then we haven't been engaging with them. I suspect that'll absolutely happen, but I also think

251
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,560
there will be plenty that don't mind. But this is what you have to do.

252
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:05,060
[Sina] So Anna has a really good story. I mean if you want to tell it.

253
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,820
[Anna] About the painter?

254
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,540
[Sina] Yeah

255
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:17,120
[Anna] Yeah, so Sina got us all thinking about this all the time. The process of describing

256
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,560
[Sina] They actually think about accessibility
more than I do

257
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,340
[Laughter]

258
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,840
[Anna] Possibly true.

259
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,340
[Susan] Because we're learning

260
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:31,760
[Anna] We're learning, we're veraciously consuming information. So one of the things I do here

261
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,780
at the museum is the video production, overseeing the video production. And so we were interviewing

262
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:42,240
Jack Whitten who actually has a show at the Walker right now, I think it's still up

263
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,780
and is in our collection. And so he was in town, and we wanted to interview him while he was in town.

264
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:53,320
about the piece of art in our collection which is a painting. It's a very abstract painting

265
00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:00,700
and I thought as an exercise, I'll ask him to describe his own painting, what are the colors,

266
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:11,180
how would you describe this to someone who couldn't see it. And he did a sort of poetic, physical description

267
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:18,240
of the painting, but then immediately digressed into this story, bringing tears to his eyes,

268
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,600
of having an exhibition where he gave permission to the registrars to let people touch his paintings

269
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,180
and so a blind tour came through and they were able to touch his paintings and feel all of the surfaces

270
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:35,620
because there are these very flat swaths of paint that have been, he calls it a developer

271
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:41,020
but he drags across the canvas that makes the colors blend together in a peculiar way

272
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,800
and there's a hard stop at the end so there's a bit of texture, so there's this smooth surface

273
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:53,620
with all kinds of drys made into the surface until you hit the edge and it was really like

274
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:59,520
to hear an artist open up and talk about their work in a way that they wouldn't normally in an interview

275
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,720
it was fantastic. And so these kinds of experiences are constantly opening up here.

276
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:15,540
[Susan] We have all of these fantasies. We have this idea that we might combine these descriptions with

277
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,040
sign language, which we're learning about, because, again, just beginning to learn, and

278
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:30,260
as we groom signers, who are especially dramatic, because they all seem to be destined for the theater

279
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,800
we had this idea that it would be really kind of cool to see these descriptions acted out

280
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:47,360
or at least signed. There's a lot to it that allows us to think about interpreting pictures

281
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,160
in many many dimensions that we were expecting. Because honestly, most museums think

282
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,020
this is the dullest thing we could possibly do with your time.

283
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,900
[Sina] We changed that.

284
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,660
[Susan] We changed that.

285
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,680
[SIna] We had some questions in the middle, I think.

286
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,220
[Elizabeth] Oh, I had a question. I was just very interested. You had mentioned that you got a

287
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:11,100
really good response when you sent out emails and I am wondering, my immediate thought was

288
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:19,720
you got that really good response probably because all of your people are very engaged and really proud of

289
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,180
the place that they work. Would you say that would be the case?

290
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:29,100
[Susan] Yes, but I don't think they necessarily ...  you're going to assume that they are going to be proud

291
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,120
because it's an art museum or because they are inherently creative. And I think there is a lot of that.

292
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:41,740
But I think there is also the sense of ... people working at non-profits are often in it because they wanted to be

293
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:48,660
in a place that is just doing good. And I think that the accessibility aspect of this,

294
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:58,840
serving underserved communities, offering something that, to people who we've basically we've closed

295
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:06,400
our doors to in the past because, you know, to hear Sina talk about, there's not a lot for a blind person

296
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:14,740
in this building, is something that a lot of them respond to, totally independently to the art.

297
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:21,440
[Sina] And, just to set the stage here, the first time, if it wasn't all, oh my goodness,

298
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,900
ramp up to five hundred descriptions and then a thousand, there was one spreadsheet

299
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:31,260
Anna sent out I think and it was to elicit responses, this is when the software was still being developed

300
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,180
so that flow didn't exist, so they just wanted to gather it in a spreadsheet, and it came back empty

301
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:44,620
like empty, zero. So, it really is a story about going from zero to sixty, it's not just everything was

302
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:52,740
sunflowers and meadows, from day one. But I think part of that was just, nothing to do with accessibility

303
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:59,360
to be honest with you, its basic social engineering, get people involved, get them involved in groups

304
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,180
do the partner exercises, have the descriptions be meaningful, so when we had conference calls

305
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,320
and they were describing things, one of the things I remember really clearly from those calls

306
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,200
is that folks would read the descriptions that they had authored. And it was really cool.

307
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,300
And when they were reading it, there honestly was very little, at least I felt, maybe they were just

308
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:28,920
looking really angrily at the speakerphone, so Susan can tell me, but I didn't really feel a lot of pride of ownership

309
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,280
in the bad sense of that word. In other words, I don't care of you can't see it, it's my awesome description.

310
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:41,000
It was a lot more like I never thought about mentioning her race before, or that's really interesting

311
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,300
should we use the word naked or should we use the nude and what are the implications there in

312
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,040
what if it's an erotic painting? So there were all these interesting discussions that came out of

313
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:59,920
actually thinking about this for the first time, so the thing I appreciate most about this particular group of people

314
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:07,520
a lot of them are not in the room right now, is the ability to bring deep thought to something

315
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,620
to take it seriously, and then everything else stems from there in my mind.

316
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,880
[Anna] And, Sina just demonstrated another factor, which is, having the trainings with Sina

317
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,960
that means therefore connecting people with someone who can directly praise them

318
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,340
and thank them, was a huge factor, because we had a room full of people working together

319
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:35,600
they'd do some descriptions and then Sina would end every call with "and by the way, and not as a consultant,

320
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:44,740
thank you." And I think that is such a huge motivator. You could feel the other kind of cry in the room.

321
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,180
[Sina] Right, right.

322
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:58,480
[Susan] We were talking earlier, just to pile onto the training note, and this is not specific to Coyote,

323
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,780
in fact this is not about Coyote at all, we were talking to somebody from the park service

324
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:11,020
about the nature of Sina's consultancy with us, and why it had worked, and I think it was kind of worth repeating

325
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:18,620
what we said to him, because he was asking a lot ... and we were remembering that the very first deliverable

326
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:26,780
for Sina when we hired him was to engage with our developers, who actually had not had any

327
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:35,580
accessibility training, and he trained them. Then was available to them, and it was a very important part of our

328
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:41,400
being able to a.) make the site accessible but b.) integrate Coyote with the site.

329
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:53,580
All of that is not perfect or done yet, but making available the knowledge so it wasn't hard ...

330
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,200
[Sina] And the other advantage of that, there's an emergent effect that happens there

331
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,200
which is that those developers don't only develop for the MCA, it's not an in-house team

332
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,500
and so what happens is that on future projects, I already know for a fact that they've written

333
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:13,400
some little helper libraries for themselves, a little JavaScript things that they used to do all the time

334
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,320
that they now do differently because, why not, it looks the same, it happens to be way more accessible

335
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,760
there's cool things like that, things they are integrating into their workflow, like

336
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,000
automatically checking for a few accessibility things here and there, that they're applying to other projects

337
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,480
and, it goes even further than that because, institutions like the MCA, there's several others clients that do this

338
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,100
as well, if you start living the ... and by the way, this one library that you are using is open source

339
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:44,540
you've already solved this problem, because you had to for you, giving back and publishing that back

340
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:50,080
into the community helps everyone else who is now using that thing, sometimes knowingly

341
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,020
and sometimes unknowingly. They'll just say "I use blah blah blah video player" or whatever

342
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:00,160
and they don't even realize "Oh, the buttons are now tab-able for somebody who can see perfectly fine

343
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,720
but ... [audience cough] ...  because they can't move a mouse, I think that's a neat contribution

344
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,880
that comes out of work like this.

345
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,700
Any other questions?

346
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,600
[Jen] This is Jen. Could you back up a couple of steps in time and tell us a little more about the origin story

347
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,800
of this effort? I'm so curious about ...

348
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,480
[Susan] So it's actually ...

349
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,980
[Sina] I call it, you always get to tell this one.

350
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
[Laughter]

351
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,700
[Susan] April. I mean the origin story is not backed up that much.

352
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,980
[Anna] You want to mention when we first met Sina?

353
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:36,320
[Sina] Well, so, I remember it very clearly. I actually where I was, how I was holding my thumb.

354
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,580
Which is weird, but ...

355
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,200
[Laughter]

356
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,380
[Sina] I also actually remember because I was heavily excite and threw it across the room. Um ...

357
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,400
[Laughter]

358
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:51,320
[Sina] Yeah, it was great. But basically we were talking about images, and I remember actually being

359
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:51,880
[cough]

360
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,420
[Sina] on Susan's part, which was I was a little reluctant. I said, ok guys, here's the deal,

361
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,020
I'm going to lay this out for you.

362
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,160
[Susan] Oh yes.

363
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:04,560
[Sina] What you are saying, because Susan was very much doing her usual, which is like,

364
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:11,640
forget bare minimums, and even average, we're going to be like, what's after triple A, let's be quad

365
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,440
[Laughter]

366
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,720
[Anna] Guys, guys, guys, think about scope.

367
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,960
[Laughter]

368
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,940
[Anna] Deadlines

369
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,740
[Laughter]

370
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,020
[Sina] So, describe every image in there. They're like "yeah, totally."

371
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,040
I'm not going to do it right now, it might take five years. Yeah, why not. Let's commit.

372
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:35,580
So then there was a pause where I go ... are you sure? And they're very affirmative about that.

373
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,840
So then the next step is how, how do we do that, and that's kind of where Coyote started coming up

374
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,700
because you know I was pointing out to them, every museum has their own

375
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:49,760
objects collection management system and TMS and all these other things and what do you want to do about

376
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,640
storing all of these descriptions, and that's where we started that deep thinking thing

377
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,100
which I really appreciate about MCA, we immediately started going to, what about other languages

378
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:03,260
what about the multiplicity of voices as Anna calls it, where it's this idea of having

379
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:09,180
different descriptions per image, so that's where Coyote kind of came about as a not only a workflow tool but a

380
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:16,720
repository, if you will, to hold these different kinds of descriptions in a programmatically accessible way

381
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,460
so that the website could draw from it.

382
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:24,760
[Susan] And we egg each other on, which is, sometimes a problem. So immediately as we began to think about

383
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:31,460
a repository we sought as a research tool,  on top of everything else, this is an emergent practice

384
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:40,260
and there are a lot of different ways that you formalize a practice, but one of them is just a bunch of people

385
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,900
sitting around talking and saying shouldn't you describe the skin color of a subject in a painting?

386
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:51,840
But the other is, really taking a big dataset, which we began to see, we can collect and especially

387
00:33:51,840 --> 00:34:01,300
aggregate with other people's data and study and analyze and so that's a part of the project

388
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,780
we haven't talked about but that we absolutely see in the future and maybe we won't do that work

389
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:12,420
maybe somebody else will come along and grab our datasets and do work on it, or maybe

390
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:19,980
we'll look at some pieces and others will look at other pieces but it was important to us almost immediately

391
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:26,380
to think about rigorous method for storing and organizing information so that they can be studied

392
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,600
by someone, hopefully us.

393
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:34,020
[Anna] And actually that is another factor of the workflows helps the commitment

394
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,700
I think of the ... all these people, everyone can see each other's descriptions in the software

395
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:47,620
so you're not like out alone, in the dark, trying to describe like "oh, I'm afraid, oh I think I might be"

396
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,940
you can look at how other people are describing to get a little courage, of like "oh, ok, so-and-so did it that way

397
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:58,600
that's interesting, I'd do it this way" and you can add to each others, so there is this,

398
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,360
still this community basis to the way this data is collected.

399
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:08,220
[Susan] I don't think we have actually said that it is our intention that the software to be available to anybody.

400
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,740
[Sina] Yes.

401
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:17,600
[Susan] and that we're not really ready for it to be fully deposited, but that we're happy

402
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:23,800
for you to be in touch with us if you have a thought to using it at some point, but also

403
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:30,600
we can give you a login so you can take a look, so you can poke around a bit

404
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:39,460
and sort of see what it looks like. I mean it does actually work, it pulls images needing descriptions from our site

405
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,240
and it pushes descriptions back out, I mean basics.

406
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,220
[Anna] Once approved.

407
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,140
[Susan] Once approved

408
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,700
[Anna] Which is why we'll let you in.

409
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,780
[Laughter]

410
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,200
[Susan] Yes, you can't put anything you want in there. But I'm never going to get around to it.

411
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,760
[Laughter]

412
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,160
[Elizabeth] So can we describe one if we wanted to?

413
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,900
[Susan] Absolutely, please do. Absolutely. As a matter of fact, if you think you might start describing

414
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,320
we'll give you your own login.

415
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,300
[Laughter]

416
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:13,500
[Sina] Absolutely. And if you're interested in doing that, and again, terms and conditions and so forth,

417
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:22,520
but in the mean time, if you are interested in that at all, even if it's only one, please get in touch with us.

418
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,100
[Elizabeth] Well, considering I started my college career as, in painting and print making,

419
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:32,940
so I'm particularly interested. And I really want to see the painting...

420
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,620
[Susan] I guess we should

421
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:39,780
[Elizabeth] I have a visual image in my head, and I want to see if I'm right.

422
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,640
[Elizabeth] Kind of what I pictured...

423
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,140
[Anna] It's really great with the lights.

424
00:36:54,140 --> 00:37:01,180
[Susan] Terrible, terrible. It's actually ... if you come back anytime soon, it's in our lobby right now.

425
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:10,760
It is a painting by Kerry James Marshall, the great Chicago painter, who's retrospective will run until April

426
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,160
just a plug there, well, because...

427
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,040
[Laughter]

428
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:22,920
[Susan] And the show is organized by us, but it's going on to the Met, and to the Los Angeles Museum of Art

429
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,400
[Anna] I have friends from all over coming to see it here.

430
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:40,520
[Susan] And to see it here because Terry has been very involved in ... This is interesting because

431
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:50,260
his paintings which are representational, not realistic, but representational are also very very complex

432
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:58,600
and politically motivated in many ways, or at least, ethically motivated on a lot of ways

433
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:05,200
and there's a lot here that is not in the visuals. And we are not trying to do all of that

434
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,500
but it is very difficult to discipline yourself, to not talk about the question of,

435
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:18,120
the representation of black people in art. Because it is all there in what he has put on the canvas.

436
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:25,680
But you know, blind people actually have access to all that scholarly research, they just don't have access to ...

437
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:33,920
the colors are orange, and brown and yeah. The composition is this, so ...

438
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,380
we're not trying to do everything with it.

439
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,880
[Anna] It's funny, reading the description ...

440
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,840
[Susan] Is that the one I would have written?

441
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,840
[Anna] It's not the one I would have written, but it's also interesting how, reading it again and again,

442
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:55,300
now I'm sort of seeing the hints at various meanings, given the description, that I didn't ...

443
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,420
yeah like, this description had ... I sort of like wow, you really managed to leave out all of those

444
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:06,580
political information. I'm like, oh yeah, she isn't strictly following, strictly ... I was like nice choice of words.

445
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,980
[Laughter]

446
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:15,400
[Elizabeth] And just ... the things that ... the descriptions match the painting in some way

447
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:23,680
I guess ... how would I say this, I don't know, it was just "paint by numbers," the voice, the tone of the description

448
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,020
matches the painting. When she said paint by numbers, and then when you started with African-American,

449
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:34,080
I mean those two things stood out to me immediately saying "ok, there is something going on there"

450
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,300
but there was no over political statement or anything like that, that means something.

451
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:48,160
[Susan] There's much more to these than people expect from visual description as we've been taught

452
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:55,480
it should be and I think this is the thing that surprised us that not only could that be done,

453
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:02,520
but also we could live with it, but Sina didn't say that's not how it should be all bolded, all clinical

454
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,400
using these kind of words, you have to describe it in this order, we were all a little surprised in our first trainings

455
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,580
that there weren't more rules, that it didn't need to be more structured, that this could be

456
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:22,160
a service in some way or another, and Sina challenged us to think about how we wanted these descriptions

457
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:32,100
to express our values and not some abstract idea or standard. I'm not sure that there

458
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,760
might be other appreciable people out in the accessibility community who would say

459
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,060
"Woa, this is way too wild west for me." Right?

460
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:47,080
[Sina] For sure. Especially with art, I think the immediate ... I talked with several folks about this project without

461
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,520
mentioning things like that, just to gauge opinions over drinks like that.

462
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:59,620
And basically, a lot of it is immediate dismissal, not because of the value. I think the value proposition

463
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:05,300
is really quick. "Oh yeah, totally. I totally agree that an art museums content should be described." Et cetera.

464
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:11,920
But, they come back to you with is well, "Oh, art is so subjective, so why bother?"

465
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,920
You've been in accessibility for twenty years, Come on!

466
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,080
[Laughter]

467
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:26,800
[Sina] And that's the reaction that is not happening here. Past the fast forward and past the why bother

468
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:36,120
into the how, and it turns out that the how involves an incredible amount of richness that you don't usually get

469
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,040
with ... you know you can write scripts basically to describe, mathematical diagrams right,

470
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,160
it's very straightforward

471
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,820
[Susan] You can actually write scripts to describe many representable paintings.

472
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:51,440
[Sina] Absolutely, you can describe the subject, a little of the form and color, and there's rules for this.

473
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:59,440
But the thing is that then you lose a lot. And the other real thing is that why bother

474
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,720
looking at the MCA's description, and I think there is a lot to be said for ...

475
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,300
You know one of my pet peeves is, actually it came up earlier today, and it's something that comes up a lot

476
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,820
which is "Well, blind people don't go to art museums anyways" and that's true ...

477
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,780
who's problem is that? And you should work on that.

478
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,960
As opposed to blind people don't go to art museums anyway, let's move on to the next thing. Right?

479
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:31,440
So I'm trying to get that to be a thing and I think it involves the other side as well.

480
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,240
I think that as I talk to more of my friends who are blind or my friends who have other disabilities

481
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,640
getting them to realize that just because museums haven't been accessible in the past traditionally

482
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,160
and, you know, I can say that, that doesn't mean they have to be going forward.

483
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:56,940
[Susan] I spoke at an event at the Goodman Theater this fall that was hosted by ADA 25

484
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:04,700
it was a cultural accessibility summit and one of the other speakers was a blind lady

485
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:13,740
and I read a description of a work we had installed at the time of a hot air balloon that was all blown up

486
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,000
you could go inside of it.

487
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,080
[Sina] That's my favorite.

488
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:23,560
[Susan] It's a great great description and she, at the end of the summit, she was on the stage

489
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,040
doing some closing remarks and she said, you know, and somebody asked her this question

490
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:34,560
what do you do with your time, it seemed a little weird but, and she gave a beautiful, beautiful answer

491
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:41,540
about all the things that she does, but then she said you know, I don't go to museums very much because

492
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:47,980
I don't really feel a warm welcome but I have to say after hearing that description of that hot air balloon

493
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:56,500
I'm going to the MCA. I thought wow, we just totally won the day. And she did come actually,

494
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:03,460
she came and was escorted through the hot air balloon by one of our guest services staff, the whole nine yards.

495
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,740
[Sina] Any other questions, comments?

496
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,260
[Nikki] I have a question, so it sounds like Coyote is proprietary to MCA.

497
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:14,760
[Susan] No.

498
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:21,780
[Sina] Just, just for right now. The plan is totally to, let's agree on license, let's throw it on to GitHub,

499
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,840
the whole thing, yeah.

500
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,180
[Nikki] So then the next question, what other applications do you see this on?

501
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:35,240
[Susan] For Coyote itself, or for the descriptions? Yeah, we have lots of ideas.

502
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:42,340
First and foremost, Sina is going to divorce us as our consultant if we don't find a way to make them available

503
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:47,900
within the gallery space. So that basically somebody who wants to ...

504
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,640
[Sina] who wants to come here physically

505
00:44:49,640 --> 00:45:00,580
[Susan] Like that's so easy to do ... they will be very useful in gallery...

506
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,780
[Nikki] They already have like the headsets.

507
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,000
[Susan] Well, everyone walks around with that

508
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,500
[Sina] With their phone, right?

509
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:18,600
[Susan] What I'd love to see is a whole sort of culture of those descriptions being available in Chicago

510
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:26,220
so that people can expect, it's expectation that causes, that grows on our audiences

511
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:33,120
so if you know that, you go to a place and they're going to have descriptions, you'll look for them.

512
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:40,320
But, we are, I think there's just times when where done with them and some of it not by us.

513
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:48,760
So our goal would be to make these descriptions available for folks to use ... if you are a teacher

514
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:55,620
if you are a researcher, you know, whatever.

515
00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:02,580
[Sina] One of our colleagues in Baltimore invited some art history students, the traditional training.

516
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,300
Susan was talking about ... the professor send a couple of students ... this is,

517
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,780
if you guys have been following the weather, Baltimore had this insane blizzard, they had fifteen people

518
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:16,980
scheduled to come from the art history class, five of them still came, during all the snow and everything

519
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:22,120
And they showed up and they spent a little bit of time receiving very similar training,

520
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,620
not anywhere near as much as done here, and they went through and described a couple of images

521
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:33,540
and they did some surveys, how did you find this experience, would you come again,

522
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:39,300
would you tell a friend ... positive across the board. But, then the professor wrote back to our colleague

523
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:46,820
and said, the next day, the next week or something like that, she took them to another thing,

524
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:53,760
another museum or it was an art thing where they were trying to do critical analysis of art

525
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:01,180
and every single one of them, at different points in time, actually independently brought up description

526
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:07,400
as one of the things that they thought about during that experience, even though it wasn't an accessibility thing

527
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,360
or anything along those lines. And the reason why I'm telling this story is because Im really into

528
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,860
I don't know if you are familiar with Randy Pausch and The Last Lecture but one of the concepts

529
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,800
he has in there is the head fake. And so confirmation bias is a beautiful tool if you're trying to

530
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,600
manipulate people into thinking "Oh my god, this is the most delicious pizza"

531
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,520
but it's also an awesome tool if you just have twenty people come up and say

532
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,760
"hey, are these accessibly described?" and eventually, humans start behaving as

533
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,340
"wow, these should totally be accessibly described," and it works way better than

534
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:45,440
thou shalt, or you must do this thing, it almost changes the framework of thinking about things into

535
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,000
wait, why isn't it. Like whenever you want somebody to do some thing, don't ask them "can this be done?"

536
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,760
ask them "how can this be done." You've already taken no off the table. You should start from there.

537
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:02,560
So that's one of the "strategicals" I have for it. But then you can name it ... Twitter, crowdsourcing, muple,

538
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:09,100
indoor navigation, delivery of images across institutions, descriptions that actually do embody

539
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:15,260
multiplicity and voices, integration with Wikipedia bots, I mean this is like, muti-lingual, look how specific

540
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:21,120
descriptions on demand for different services, if you guys are familiar with the Be My Eyes app

541
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,760
for example, right. So you turn it on, you can either signup as a describer or

542
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:31,360
somebody who wants things described, there's so many things like that you can start delivering accessibility

543
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:38,820
and therefore inclusive design as a service, that helps everybody that I see. The software is just,

544
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:43,400
to me, technology is just a tool, I'm into technology, my background is computer science, but still,

545
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:50,240
it's just a way for getting stuff done. It's just a really cool way to add that multiplication factor

546
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,100
that force augmentation factor. But, don't know if that answered your question.

547
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,420
[Audience] No, definitely, thank you.

548
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:02,400
[Audience member] I have a question. So, since you developed the software, can you talk a little bit about

549
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,680
the accessibility of it? How it rates with the website? And how does that division work?

550
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,340
[Sina] So, is your background development? Like technology?

551
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:21,380
[Audience member] Well, I'm somewhere between that. I'm not a developer but I have a technical background.

552
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:26,420
[Sina] So I'll give you an overview, then I'm happy to talk to you offline about it. But basically,

553
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,460
it's a web application, it's written in Ruby on Rails,  it has a JSON API, it's a RESTful API that can be

554
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:38,320
pulled to and pushed to. It's able to maintain state across instances, of course, it's backed by a database,

555
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:43,160
and it pulls from the MCA's content management system. So it gets updates from a dictionary,

556
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,880
it goes through and says I don't know about this meaning id. That's an un-described image,

557
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:53,140
and then it just puts that into the workflow and says, this should be described, and then that becomes an entity

558
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:59,560
of the system. So now, that entity gets all of these descriptions. And then, on the reverse side,

559
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:04,960
on the flip side, the web site can go, oh, I have an image here. I'm going to programatically

560
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,560
I'm going to store the alt text for it, I'm going to ask it for it, I'm going to ask Coyote for it,

561
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,560
and that's really important because if you think about it, that can change. Susan might approve

562
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,240
another description. Or Anna might go ahead and say, we gotta spell check, we have a spelling thing here,

563
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:27,920
we gotta fix that. And so, you want to make sure that's done dynamically, you're not just storing it as a file,

564
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,120
as a description. As far as the accessibility of the software, it's an interesting question,

565
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:37,360
because you're asking, is the software used primarily to describe undescribed definitions,

566
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:42,140
by definition, is that accessible? We tried really hard to make that the case.

567
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:47,280
Appropriate use of ARIA where possible, WCAG 2 double A was the standard

568
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,180
they're buttons, not links styled as buttons, table navigation where tables are actually useful,

569
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:59,020
not because it's easy to layout things that way, proper use of headings and ARIA live regions for

570
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:03,580
announcing pop-ups and things like that so the whole nine yards as far as all that goes.

571
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:08,880
I use the system myself and I'm obviously a screen reader user and I can use it just fine.

572
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,760
[Audience member] Great, thanks.

573
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,680
[Sina] But for other disabilities as well, we don't want to make it just for blind people.

574
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,920
[Susan] Although we want Sina to describe images...

575
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,960
[Sina] Yeah, that's a different problem.

576
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,960
[Laughter]

577
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,360
[Sina] Any other questions?

578
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:33,180
[Renee] Does the MCA have tactile versions of images?

579
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:38,820
[Susan] Of works ... so tactile ...

580
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,700
[Renee] I mean here obviously, not on the web.

581
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:57,320
[Susan] Yes, no, of works in the collection. We don't have any. It's not something ... we would really love to be ...

582
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:11,060
an institution that has accessibility programs of all sorts, touch is a tricky one, and I have to say

583
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:19,900
I'm not so inclined to love tactile reproduction, but I'd love to have touch stores for example

584
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:28,080
I think that works, it's easy enough ... magnificent touch stores, something that is really uncomfortable

585
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:35,780
for our registration team. They're pretty conservative and ... like many small museums,

586
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:42,140
we don't have a huge security staff to manage and an understanding of what can be touched, what can't

587
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:46,620
so they take a really conservative approach to touching anything ...

588
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:50,140
[Anna] Except I realized the plaza project, which ...

589
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,200
[Susan] Oh yes.

590
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,480
[Anna] It's like the one thing that can be touched.

591
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,000
[Susan] That and actually I think one of the interesting things that are happening in Chicago is

592
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,080
there's some really good tours for the blind that are architecture focused, and I'd really like to see us

593
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:07,360
have a touch tour, based on the architecture in this building, which is an important architectural space.

594
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,040
[Sina] I also think that there's other aspects here. So when we talk about replicas, especially tactile

595
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:19,760
there's a resolution problem there. When we are talking about the swirling of colors, it's really easy to ...

596
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,780
No problem, here's what you do, you take the colors and you map them to different textures, and then you

597
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,980
take those different textures and you use elevation and et cetera, but it turns out that through neuroscience

598
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:34,620
and other things, we actually know a little bit about how much the fingertip can feel and things like that

599
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:41,340
and it's not as easy as mapping those things. A lot of times with tactile graphics, my experience not only

600
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:49,880
as a user but also as somebody with a background with this stuff, you'll get a tactile graphic, and it will look

601
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,400
and I use that word visibly, and it will look gorgeous. Seriously, its a work for art. I mean,

602
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:00,620
some of these tactile graphics are incredible. The line spacing is really good and you can see it and

603
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:06,460
wow, this is awesome. And if you then give that to someone who's blind, you should do this

604
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:11,980
in a controlled setting ... you realize that the information content is kind of not there

605
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:19,280
they may get some general appearances and things like that, but its because those spacings are appropriate for vision

606
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,500
they are not appropriate for tactile. So what you actual want to really do is a tactile replica correctly

607
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:28,220
and it is doable, I don't want to say its not. I was in Pittsburg at the Andy Warhol Museum

608
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:32,660
and they have a tactual replica of the Soup Can, the most iconic Andy Warhol.

609
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:39,000
It's really cool. It's really easy to tell that that is a Campbell Soup Can. It's like three feet high

610
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,820
and pretty close to scale. They have another one that he did which is a side profile of, I think it's a few people

611
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:52,400
I don't remember, it might just be a woman in a car, and it's an old style car from like the 1920's or what not

612
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:59,060
maybe the 40's, and it's this side view, it's very elongated, that was a lot harder to tell

613
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:06,240
what is going on, until it's pointed out to you, and again, it's having to do with the Campbell Soup Can

614
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,460
it's a lot of empty space, it really gives you that ability to move around and use appropriate perception

615
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:15,340
appropriately, so I don't want to make it sound like an impossible problem, because I've got some friends

616
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:20,300
who do some amazing things with 3-D printing and tactile graphics and things like that.

617
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:25,460
But, it's hard. It's a hard problem.

618
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,360
[Jen] It's Jen again. How did you get buy in and funding to do this?

619
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,960
[Susan] Ah, we didn't.

620
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,960
[Laughter]

621
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:49,820
[Susan] So my philosophy is that, well one of my philosophies is that you should ...

622
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:56,580
if you say something enough times, it becomes a truth. So, Anna and I started saying around the museum

623
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:02,700
"Hey, we're really leading the community in being about accessibility."

624
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,860
"This is an institution that is committed to accessibility."

625
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:14,280
A, when Sina was talking about the house that you are building and how much more expensive it is

626
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,500
to build the addition, it's also much easier when you are building the house to swallow the cost

627
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:25,260
of that extra room, you don't absolutely notice the big numbers, so we were just building a website

628
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:32,860
and so we just frankly, um, "did you just, Dennis, yeah", nobody noticed that there was accessibility funding ...

629
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:36,960
[Anna] It was a line in the budget for the website.

630
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:46,420
[Susan] And all, yeah, technology, right? But in terms of this institution's commitment to accessibility

631
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:52,180
in the digital space, honestly, we said it a lot of times and now other people say it to.

632
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:58,460
And I just think that works for me virtually every time, except for my husband, but ... no ...

633
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,880
[Laughter]

634
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,420
[Sina] You're going to egg me for saying this, but you just laid out the Donald Trump model of accessibility.

635
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,320
Oh No! [Laughter]

636
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,860
[Susan] Wait, that's not true ... well ... yeah.

637
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,700
[Anna] No, he's just copying her.

638
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,320
[Laughter]

639
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,900
[Susan] I think it's really really tough because, we were saying earlier, you know, you can't say the word

640
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:25,900
people have all of these biases against, you just have to start trying stuff.

641
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,980
[Sina] You know, Tim Cook has a quote, the CEO of Apple, right. He has this thing where,

642
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:40,380
he was at a stockholder meeting and one of their larger institutional investors, had millions of shares

643
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:47,880
of Apple stock, was giving him a really hard time about data centers and green energy and all of this other stuff

644
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:53,740
and he keeps hounding the guy, and Tim finally, for those of you who know, he's a very quiet,

645
00:57:53,740 --> 00:58:00,340
soft-spoken, very calm individual, doesn't lose his cool ever, and he finally gets mad at the guy and is like

646
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:07,380
"Look, if you don't like it, feel free to exist the stock." But he also says "When we do stuff like that,

647
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:13,000
green energy or accessibility, we do it because it is the right thing to do, and I don't consider the bloody return

648
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,360
on investment." Now, the reason that I bring it up is, it's awesome. It's like Yay!

649
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:22,920
Fortune 500 company definitely doing some awesome stuff and doing it for the right reasons

650
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:29,140
but here's the reality. The actual reality, the business reality for Apple is that they made money

651
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:33,080
off of accessibility and surely invested hundreds of thousands, probably by now they've invested

652
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,600
millions actually in accessibility. They've made tends of millions off of that, from education

653
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:45,520
to a lot of other initiatives. Even their kiosk ... in fact, the kiosk that museums use is an accessibility feature.

654
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:52,340
And they use it for different reasons, but it's fantastic for children with autism and other users with autism.

655
00:58:52,340 --> 00:59:00,680
It's one of those things where, if you take a multitude of these kinds of social engineering, everything else,

656
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:06,520
and then also realize that accessibility doesn't have to be phrased as a cost center,

657
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:12,480
you can get very far, and I've seen that now be successful at several different museums,

658
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:19,540
several different start-ups, one venture fund, a couple of larger corporations and then universities are a lot easier

659
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:25,000
universities have that mandate, so for them, that's not so much of an issue,

660
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,080
but all those over ones that I listed, that model seems to work.

661
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:36,140
[Susan] And actually, I have no doubt that the position that we've taken on accessibility that we will ...

662
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:42,760
it won't be a cost center for us in the traditional sense, there's funding to be had for the work that we're doing

663
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:52,580
we're 100% positive. But making that argument, think before you start, is a whole lot harder than

664
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:57,480
making that argument when you started a little. And I mean honestly, as much as we've done,

665
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:08,000
I feel we're started a little, but just enough, to continue to realize that, funding and that sort of value to reputation

666
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,140
all of that good stuff that non-profits like.

667
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:18,180
[Anna] It's possible that its becoming quite hip. It's so cool right now.

668
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:23,980
I was talking to a friend about description and she got so excited. She's a choreographer, filmmaker

669
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:27,720
and she said "I've been doing description!" And I said "What do you mean?"

670
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:33,380
She was living in Berlin and took some workshop with a dancer and they were doing description as choreography

671
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:41,680
and that lead her to take a description course. So she took a course in live description, and now it's like crazy

672
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:47,880
it's now like everywhere. I had another friend do a performance, she's an artist out in San Diego

673
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:53,260
and it turned out she was doing these description-based performances and not even realizing that there was this

674
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:59,860
whole other world, and now she's super excited to get certified to do description for video.

675
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:06,740
And it's weird that it's become this very hip thing that actually makes it so much easier

676
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,940
to move things forward.

677
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:11,640
[Susan] Hip for artists but also hip for funders. I was saying in a meeting earlier,

678
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:22,460
that ADA 25 was a lot in terms of awareness and for funders, I think that sort of changes everything.

679
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:29,220
We, of course, are caring something that is inherently sexy, art, with something that is now trendy,

680
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:38,140
accessibility, so we get a little bit of a heads up, we're not trying to make a gas company, an oil company

681
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:46,500
website accessible. So it helps us with the funding. But I actually don't think there's that much of a difference.

682
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,560
A willingness for people to put something into this.

683
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,720
[Nikki] I have a question. It is trendy, right. And it's cool and I think there are a lot of people,

684
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:04,920
and there's a huge community here in Chicago. Have you guys thought at all about engaging

685
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:10,680
with that network of people at all, just to see if they could contribute to doing the descriptions.

686
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:18,860
[Susan] We absolutely have. We want to have a tool that's finished before we ...

687
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:24,840
... no, but we think about it a lot. Which communities would be interested and

688
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:31,160
how would we engage with them. I said something super insensitive at the very beginning of the process

689
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:35,300
which is "I wonder of deaf people would be interested in helping us describe."

690
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,520
And today, somebody who is a representative of the deaf community came up to me and said

691
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:42,600
"We'd really like to help you describe."

692
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,480
[Laughter]

693
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:54,360
[Susan] But, you know, we have been in conversation with the poetry foundation, about that community

694
01:02:54,360 --> 01:03:02,500
I do think that this museum has a really, really important relationship with local artists that we'd love to tap

695
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:09,880
but also arts professionals; teachers and the like. There's really so many possibilities for us.

696
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:20,160
We just ... we want people to feel as fulfilled in participating as our staff do.

697
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:27,560
I think that you don't want to let folks down. So I think we are ... we're moving more slowly than

698
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:33,160
we would want to, but really with the best of intentions.

699
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:38,680
[Anna] It would be so easy to just share with everyone and then have it sort of just flop out.

700
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:44,600
Like something that everyone forgot about. So we're being be very, very careful about,

701
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,500
is it ready for this.

702
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:52,840
[Susan] Actually, to be fair, the kinds of next partners that we're looking for are actually folks like you

703
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:59,500
who can begin to build your own networks of users and share experiences at a higher level

704
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,860
so that we can parse those and understand as a group how this works.

705
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:08,420
Because we can't manage a sort of ever expanding circle of describers.

706
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:13,980
The logical thing will be for us to in a node in the network that you belong to.

707
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:20,260
That's probably why we were excited that Dennis asked us to talk to you guys.

708
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,620
[Nikki] Given that it is a non-profit, right, and part of the community,

709
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:36,020
how do you see this giving back to the community? Are there local groups in the accessibility community

710
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:46,500
who you think would ... be excited to partake in the site? They may not even know that ... this is a feature.

711
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:52,940
[Sina] Part of that is intentional. It's sort of the slow release model, working everything out.

712
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:56,660
The other thing I'm coming to is inclusive design, making sure it's available for everyone

713
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:03,240
before we make even more noise about it, because at least it's something that I feel is really strong here

714
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:09,440
which is this idea that, accessibility is great, and everybody associates me for example with accessibility

715
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:16,600
but it's not what I ... it's a side effect for me. If you do inclusive design and usability correctly,

716
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:22,480
you get accessibility as a side effect. And you can go to a lot of boring talks that talk about that topic

717
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,540
for two hours. But the core tenant of it is actually, really true; it's not just something that people say,

718
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:36,620
it is true. And so, I think the way it gives back is ... to me, there are a couple of problems that come to mind.

719
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:45,540
Obvious user benefit, being about to appreciate, art, content in general that was unavailable to you before.

720
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:53,040
And then there is participation. So, going to a museum, while blind, and with someone else who can see

721
01:05:53,040 --> 01:06:02,960
it's just like, yeah, it's totally doable, I've done it before. Several times. But it's not exactly in my top ...

722
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,760
Right, but then there is the participation of the other end that Susan and I were talking about

723
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:15,740
curators ... and realizing that the museum is actually part of the community and really wanting to give

724
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:23,000
in that sense, and then I think its allowing folks to be participatory in the process

725
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:29,720
of making the rest of the content, or world, or whatever, accessible. Right, or accessible to them.

726
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:36,720
And that's a big thing for me; involving end users. So not only having then read descriptions, but

727
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:44,340
you could imagine later on almost a Reddit-style, voting interface. Where you vote up or down descriptions.

728
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:55,720
Because ... [overlapping talking] ... So it's things like that that I think, this is groundwork, it is early days

729
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:01,880
as Susan says, but, I think your question is incredibly important, because it contributes back

730
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,620
in a lot of different ways, it's not just that thing you do for one disability group.

731
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:10,560
[Susan] I actually want to answer it in a different way, because I complete agree with what Sina says.

732
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:17,600
There's another thing for me that I think about a lot, which is that even if a blind person

733
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:28,320
never reads one of our descriptions, but knows that they're there, and that the project was initiated because

734
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:35,640
we wanted to support people who have a vision impairment, we're sending a message

735
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:45,700
to the community of the blind and vision impaired, folks that, we see them as creative beings

736
01:07:45,700 --> 01:08:00,700
I'm sorry this is very touchy, feely ... you're not just, as we sometimes say, ... we actually honor your potential to

737
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:06,820
do creative work and to be a person in our community of creators. Which I think is something that

738
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:13,840
museums haven't been doing. If we put that message to the world, independent of whether or not you actually

739
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:21,480
use our descriptions, that's super important. And that's, I know that sounds very abstract, but

740
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:29,060
I think it will begin to get out there in the world. You can be an artist. We believe in you.

741
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:39,880
[Anna] It's absolute and, the work Sina and I were doing on the letter that we need to write together this week

742
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:45,040
to YouTube and Vimeo about the support for multiple audio tracks because right now,

743
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:53,320
the way those interfaces work, whether it's a different language community or its an audio description

744
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:57,760
needed community, they're going to be on an entirely separate conversation thread.

745
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:05,660
Their conversation is set aside and not valued in the core, typically English-speaking

746
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:14,200
able to whatever, engage maybe through closed-captions or whatever it is, but it's a limited scope

747
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,580
that that video functions in so you have all these versions of the video, you know, and like

748
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:20,800
"Oh, I"m looking for the one with the Spanish subtitles, so I can send it to my buddy."

749
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,460
and there's a whole other conversation happening over there.

750
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:28,700
[Sina] And actually that reminded me. This kind of work does actually have one other strategic advantage.

751
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:33,620
It has a name but I have totally forgotten it. One important one that came up when Anna was saying

752
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:41,820
is that it does a very good job of highlighting barriers to folks who do want to do the right thing.

753
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:47,280
We spend a lot of time in the accessibility community, sometimes commiserating, complaining about,

754
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:52,120
motivating and conjoiling during our day jobs about folks to get into accessibility and so forth

755
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:59,640
I can't tell you the number of discussions I've had ... I like going into a room with developers

756
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:05,660
and be like, accessibility, yeah, you guys totally are thinking this meeting is going to suck.

757
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,680
[Laughter]

758
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,640
[Sina] Let's just get it out there, and by the end of it, just getting them super passionate about it.

759
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:19,760
Here's the part that's really bad. Then they go off and they'll send me an email, like, so, totally stoked,

760
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:25,280
went home to try to do this thing, hacking on it on my own time, okay. Hacking on it on my own time

761
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:30,780
Sina, where do I put the audio description track on YouTube? Ok, so here's the deal ...

762
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:35,960
You Tube mumble mumble mumble, and like that's really frustrating. So this kind of work,

763
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:42,680
highlighting those kind of obstacles and doing something about it, is really important.

764
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:50,960
[Anna] And it spins out into everything else we do. Like there's this moment where we're having issues with

765
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:58,700
the PDF viewer and uploading PDFs, and suddenly I was like, we're uploading all of these PDFs,

766
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:04,520
oh yeah, we'll just upload them all. 
Oh my god, our PDFs, they're not accessible.

767
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,220
[Laughter]

768
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,940
[Anna] So I called Sina and said "Sina, Help!"

769
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,540
[Susan] Tomorrow's PDF training.

770
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:13,540
[Sina] Yeah, tomorrow is PDF accessibility training.

771
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,980
[Laughter]

772
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:19,380
[Renee] How do you get an accessible PDF from a Mac?

773
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,560
[Susan] You should come to training tomorrow.

774
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,760
[Laughter]

775
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,640
[Sina] The answer is, if you are using InDesign, we've got it about 95% done already

776
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:34,200
because a lot of those things can be done in InDesign, and you can then export it

777
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,840
and the beautiful part about that is the classic problem that you are probably very familiar with

778
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,840
which is, some people will make PDFs and they'll go in and make it accessible, they'll use Acrobat

779
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,280
and things like that, they're going to make it accessible. Then, somebody comes in and says, guys,

780
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:53,660
the table of contents is wrong, and now you've lost all of those accessibility changes, so the fact here is that

781
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:56,780
in fact, I don't think we're going to cover any Adobe Acrobat stuff tomorrow

782
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:01,500
all of the accessibility stuff we're going to do is going to be done at the content authoring level.

783
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:05,900
So if these guys want to go in, they feel totally comfortable making content level changes

784
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:10,320
because the accessibility lives with the document.

785
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:15,260
[Susan] I can see the client look at that calendar, uhhhh.

786
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:18,540
[Anna] I reminded them, they were like yeah yeah yeah...

787
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:23,200
[Susan] So I was like, Sina, if you can make them come to that meeting ...

788
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:28,100
[Anna] Actually, a good consultant, just to give a pitch for Sina, I mean the first conversation I had

789
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:35,120
with our lead developer, of the website, after his first phone call with Sina, he was like,

790
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:42,740
"it's going to be really intense," but he had this little smile, like it's going to be really ... I'm going to learn a lot

791
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:48,800
like he was really excited about it and that energy and the excitement of ...

792
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:56,120
when we sent them this huge task list after our WCAG evaluation, they were like really into it.

793
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:59,480
[Sina] Yeah, that was really weird, actually.

794
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,800
[Laughter]

795
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:06,580
[Elizabeth] I've had that experience with developers, they are into it, you don't have to sell the developers because

796
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:10,740
it is a problem to solve and they love that.

797
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:15,040
[Sina] And you shouldn't go in, I think what happens sometimes in accessibility is ...

798
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,460
[Susan] Those are developers, we're talking tomorrow to our designers.

799
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,860
[Laughter]

800
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:26,020
[Sina] But you don't want to go in and call their baby ugly, right? And the answer is let's do things a different way.

801
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:31,180
In design, I have a buddy of mine who uses the analogy of, for designers, when you think about accessibility,

802
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:36,080
they get way more ... they struggle way more with it, in my opinion, than developers do.

803
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:40,480
And to me, I like to tell them, this is from a friend of mine, actually who is going to be

804
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:46,220
leading the PDF accessibility training session, he says, to designers, think of it as working in a different medium

805
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:52,140
and if you are telling me that you can't be just as creative in clay that you can be in blown glass or what not

806
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:56,560
you know, that's not the case. You're going to do all of these amazing things in a different medium

807
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,420
and accessibility just ensures that those foundations are really usable by more people.

808
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:04,880
So, there's just different ways I think of talking to different audiences

809
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,740
or being a sociopath as I like to call it.

810
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:09,500
[Laughter]

811
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,320
[Anna] I was crossing my fingers this whole time ...

812
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:15,880
[Elizabeth] It was interesting you said, calling your baby ugly. I am a UX researcher

813
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:21,480
so my job is to basically tell people that their baby is ugly. In a nice way.

814
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,480
[Susan] Oh, so you should see Coyote, so ...

815
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:31,620
[Renee] I have a ... when I first started hearing your presentation, coming from High Ed.,

816
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:38,840
I'm thinking of, how to help all students get through an art history class.

817
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:51,360
Okay, so, I wasn't thinking of it necessarily as a pleasant experience. You're taking about going to a

818
01:14:51,360 --> 01:15:02,160
museum with a sighted person then. It's not what you do for fun, but if you have to learn stuff.

819
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:08,100
So that's how I started thinking about this, but now I'm thinking of ...

820
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:13,180
you are aiming for these descriptions to be their own works of art.

821
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:13,800
[Susan] Yes.

822
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,980
[Renee] Not art history, but their own works of art, and I think that's cool.

823
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:26,340
[Susan] Thank you. We didn't know that that would happen and so that is a great surprise with this project.

824
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:28,960
[Sina] Dennis, how are we doing on time?

825
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:34,900
[Dennis] Well, I was going to ask you. Because you guys have had an unbelievably long day.

826
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:43,580
So, when you guys are ready to raise the white flag, let us know, but did you have a question earlier?

827
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:51,320
I'm sorry ... I'm sorry, I'm awful with names.

828
01:15:52,540 --> 01:16:00,280
[May] I'm glad that you actually said that you're incorporating other ... you know, the general population

829
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:05,100
not just for screen readers, because most times, when people think of accessibility,

830
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:14,560
if it meets screen reader needs, then it is accessible. Not true. I actually had a discussion slash argument

831
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,080
with a former president of the National Federation of the Blind and that was his concept;

832
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:25,800
if you can interact with it with a screen reader, then it's fully accessible. Not true.

833
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:32,380
So they miss a lot of things, so I'd like to know what other accessibility features or functions that you

834
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:36,800
incorporated into the website, beyond the descriptions and ... ?

835
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:46,020
[Sina] Yeah, so two things. The first is that if you look at WCAG, there's four foundational principles there.

836
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:48,840
Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust.

837
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:56,700
The P.O.U.R. principles. And there are a lot of different groups or users that you can encompass

838
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:01,880
with a lot of the things there. So for example, color contrast is very important, low vision is

839
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:07,840
an incredibly large population. Keyboard ability, for those who can't use a mouse. So I'm not talking

840
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,860
screen readers here, just regular keyboard ability, and intelligent keyboard

841
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:17,360
It doesn't just mean that you can tab to everything, because we have, what, ten thousand?

842
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,940
Is that right?  Ten thousand images. Sometimes there are page, there's pagination in the system,

843
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:26,200
sometimes you might have a thousand links on a page or something like that. So intelligent keyboard ability

844
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:33,660
really thinking about that process. With respect to cognitive, we've done a little bit of work on the back end,

845
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:40,460
with respect to just ... the amount of words on the screen. Something we're struggling a little bit is,

846
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:46,880
do we truncate and then do we have "more" buttons? There's empathetical use cases there, right?

847
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:53,020
Or at least traditionally ... use cases. For example, if you have a "more" button, what do you do for blind users?

848
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:55,860
And there are a couple of tricks. I'm not going to bore you with the details.

849
01:17:55,860 --> 01:18:02,420
But, there are things you can do to make it easier for narrow vision, narrow field of view,

850
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:08,580
for low vision, also, folks who are on, cognitive impairment spectrum, where you might want

851
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:13,680
less text on the screen, but then also not to force more keyboard strokes, not only for the sighted keyboard user,

852
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:20,880
but also for the blind user. Let's see here, what else. We've done a little bit of thinking around

853
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:29,040
this idea that if you are a ... keyboard, but mainly I'm thinking of switch users

854
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:34,240
so, things like skip to content links but also scroll back up, so jump links in the middle of the page,

855
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:39,860
especially with pagination, something that I've been struggling with a little bit, because it's a hard one.

856
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:44,660
Again, going back to this idea of having it be just as good for keyboard users,

857
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:50,080
just a good for screen reader users. The way I tend to look at it is, it's an ever increasing net

858
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,740
I think I was saying this earlier today, it's an ever increasing net. The tricky thing is,

859
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:58,740
every time you want to add, fail forward. 
Failing, awesome. Iterating, great.

860
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:05,260
Fail forward. But, make sure that when you do that, you do a check, you circle back and you say

861
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:10,180
"Did we do something that took away from another user group that we were doing really well with

862
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:16,300
and that doesn't always mean just aligning with WCAG. WCAG is awesome, and a lot of people that worked on it.

863
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:23,120
I've gone out preaching it and using it all the time. But it's not the end all, be all.

864
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:28,520
There's plenty of great principles, sometimes that are encapsulated there that you can also take advantage of.

865
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,640
Does that answer your question?

866
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:37,260
[May] Um, yes, follow-up comment. Because you can actually take away from one challenge

867
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:42,340
by trying to address another. So, color contrast is something that you mentioned which actually

868
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:47,500
is a challenge for a lot of people, because they don't use enough contrast. And so therefore you can't distinguish

869
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:53,400
foreground from background, text from the background. However, then some people take it to the extreme

870
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:59,420
they say, we'll just make it pure black text on pure white background. Now you've lost a lot of people

871
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:09,760
that have certain cognitive challenges such as dyslexia. In that aspect, people just decide

872
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,960
ok, we'll make it the maximum. Well now you've made it more challenging for another group.

873
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:20,840
[Sina] So, I think we've been pretty lucky here not to have ... so I'm very well acquainted with the polarizing

874
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,820
scenario that you are laying out, because I've had to deal with that a lot.

875
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:29,980
It's the "Oh wow, this is going to be great. Let's just totally go to the black and white."

876
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:35,120
"That's what we are going to do. Fine. We're going to have no..." We're lucky here not to have that sort of

877
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:40,260
attitude about things. But I kind of want to address your overall point. Often times,

878
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:45,740
and this is totally, I'm not stating this as a well, researched principle. But it's my opinion,

879
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:53,800
so take it for what it's worth. The answer to a cross roads of multiple usability features,

880
01:20:53,800 --> 01:21:00,840
in which one is orthogonal to the other, is sometimes resolved at least by offering the user

881
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:06,540
customizability that is stateful. And so what that means is that if you have a website in which

882
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:13,400
the color contrast can be monochromatic or color and let's just, for the sake of argument say 4.5:1.

883
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:20,240
It's just not that hard to actually make the few lines of CSS change and store them a radio button choice.

884
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:25,780
That get stored for that user as a cookie. And, those are the kinds of things that, I feel,

885
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:29,440
address some of those kind of things and take it out of the realm of "Oh, this is impossible"

886
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:37,740
into, customizability, some basic usability, then the ability to always, if you have that choice,

887
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:43,540
giving the user, this goes back to the seven principles of universal design, giving the user a way, a very easy way

888
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:47,840
of returning back to the original starting point. So if they don't like that thing,

889
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:52,840
or maybe, one day they need it to be black and white, but another day, a lot of folks with vision impairment

890
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:57,540
will tell you, their vision is not constant from day to day. Sometimes they, I have some friends who

891
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:01,900
use a screen reader only for some days. And on other days, they use large type. And that's ok.

892
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:08,380
So, having those choices be user modifiable I feel is an important way of solving that problem.

893
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:11,080
Or at least, a stab at solving the problem.

894
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:16,060
[Susan] We have a ton of users, if anyone has actually looked at our site, who would love to be able to

895
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:17,380
customize by turning off the grid.

896
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:18,180
[Sina] Yes.

897
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:22,920
[Susan] And, someday we'll convince our developer.

898
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:31,800
[Anna] And actually, that tees up a second side to this, we're operating within a design that was already created

899
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,600
[Dennis] That sounds familiar.

900
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,940
[Laughter]

901
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,760
[Anna] So there were ...

902
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:41,700
[Susan] But it really, really, rather aggressive ...

903
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:48,440
[Anna] Very rigid, very rigid, and so that was one of the things, I remember Susan saying in the beginning was

904
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:57,920
if we're going to carry this, we have to go even beyond, because this site looks the way it does

905
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:04,280
and is going to look the way it does, and our font is the way it is and ...

906
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,620
[Laughter]

907
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:08,280
[Sina] There were certain things that were invariable. You always have those in projects.

908
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:15,020
And that's just the reality, but again I feel customization can help that after the fact.

909
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:20,560
[Susan] But, just the work that our developers have done, and our designer had done,

910
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:29,200
our developer, designer team, have made them more sensitive, even to the front-facing

911
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:29,920
[Sina] Agreed.

912
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,880
[Susan] design aspects.

913
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:36,240
[Elizabeth] Have you done any usability testing with people yet?

914
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:45,280
[Sina] Yes. So, low vision, cognitive, keyboard-only but sighted, fully blind, I think I'm missing two ...

915
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,860
hard of hearing with captions and there are a couple other things, there's not too much sound

916
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:52,560
other than the video contents, those were somewhat straight forward

917
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,220
I'm missing one

918
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:55,680
[Susan] ...

919
01:23:55,680 --> 01:24:02,260
[Sina] And along the WCAG functional criteria docs was the overall basis for that

920
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:07,700
with a few usability things thrown in. And that was ... oh, cross-functional, that is what I was missing

921
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:13,820
so, we had folks, evaluate this website, I'm going to totally misplace this, a few different states

922
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:21,860
in the United States, Ireland, London, some folks up in Toronto, Vancouver, um ...

923
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:30,640
... it's been a really long day, and a couple of other places as well, and that helps a lot as well because

924
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:36,920
you'll pick up on some things where accessibility and internationalization come into play

925
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:44,700
and those are things to be aware of. Even if it's simple things, like having to display time and

926
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:50,720
making sure that is marked up correctly to the browser, to display it, this is a time field, this is a date field,

927
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:54,140
other things like that, that have back end implications as well.

928
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:55,840
[Elizabeth] Ok, thank you.

929
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,640
[Dennis] Well, I'm going to be the mean one and say, that is ...

930
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:00,580
[Sina] You're so mean.

931
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:04,220
[Dennis] ... yeah, I know. Well, that's the worst thing I've been called today, so ...

932
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:12,620
I want to thank Susan, Sina and Anna for their time today and for sharing their experiences with

933
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,760
the website. I think they all deserve a big round of applause.

934
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:18,240
[Applause]

935
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:24,900
[Dennis] Thank you so very much. The only thing I will add to this, which is totally unrelated to this is

936
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:30,600
when you get home or whenever you feel like it, please go back to the meetup site for this, please rate it

937
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:35,940
and please provide feedback, you know, was this helpful, was it not, was it missing something.

938
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:37,960
[Susan] Well, don't rate us if it wasn't helpful.

939
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,320
[Laughter]

940
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:46,000
More from the meetup side rather than the content side. Thank you so very much.

941
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,860
[Susan, Sina & Anna] Thank you.

942
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:51,540
[Applause]

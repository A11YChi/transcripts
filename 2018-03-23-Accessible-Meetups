# Accessible Meetups
Billy Gregory and Dennis Deacon
March 23, 2018

1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,000
[Presenter] Thanks very much. Enjoy the show.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,220
[Dennis Deacon]: Notice how he called it a show?

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,660
[Laughter]

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,660
[Dennis]: Probably because you're here.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,380
[Billy Gregory]: I resemble that remark.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,600
[Dennis]: So, hello everyone.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,260
Thank you for attending today's session on accessibility meetups.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,320
How many people are currently in an accessibility meetup? Raise your hands ...

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,840
[Billy]: Wow!

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,620
[Dennis]: We'll do more polling a little bit later.

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:47,360
My name is Dennis Deacon. I'm an accessibility engineer with The Paciello Group.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,900
My name is Billy Gregory. I am the Director of Training for The Paciello Group.

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:59,720
[Dennis]: And what we've decided to do today is basically to share stories of our interactions with our meetups.

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,280
I run the meetup in Chicago, Illinois in the US ...

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,300
... and I am one of the two co-organizers for a11yTO out of Toronto, Canada.

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,920
We do have a deck. We have an URL for this deck.

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:26,340
The URL is g o o dot g l forward slash eight seven capital H lowercase n lowercase w uppercase V.

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,540
This will be repeated at the end of the presentation.

19
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,320
I will say this is not going to be a content-heavy presentation deck.

20
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:43,480
It's more going to be myself and and Billy sharing stories of our experience running meetups.

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,200
So first off, what are meetups?

22
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,620
Does everyone know what a meetup is?

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,680
[Billy]: I'd say almost every hand in this room went up when we asked them if they were in one, so ...

24
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,260
[Dennis]: Well ...

25
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,360
[Laughter]

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,140
[Dennis]: Depending on the meetup ...

27
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,000
... I don't know, they drink beer ...

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,260
But, I looked up this definition and it's funny, because right before this event,

29
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,880
I tried to find this definition, I could not find ... I figured Wikipedia, but I couldn't find it.

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,680
A planned event where like-minded people meet and typically chat over cocktails ...

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,680
So right there, that concerned me.

32
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Who has cocktails?

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,520
Beer, yes. Whiskey, yes.

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,240
Cocktails I'm not sure.

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
And listen to a guest speaker.

36
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,200
I think that differs from ... I know how I run Chicago. Billy, how would you describe yours?

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,980
[Billy]: Yeah, we definitely don't run it like an episode of Mad Men.

38
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,660
So I don't think we have cocktails.

39
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:50,100
But we definitely have the guest speakers. we try to keep a lot of communication and make it more of an event,

40
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,000
as opposed to just listening to one person. We want people to interact and mix with each other.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,540
We definitely want to have a very strong, social aspect to it.

42
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,840
[Dennis]: And it's funny because I think we've tried one social event and we had two people show up,

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,540
which is why I haven't had great experience with the social aspects of meetups.

44
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,260
But I tend to be very awareness and training focused.

45
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,820
So I tend to do more presentation style.

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,860
but I'm trying to bend with that, to mix it up, to keep it fresh.

47
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,640
We'll cover that topic a little bit later on in this presentation.

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,760
So where are they today?

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:40,600
Today, in North America, there are ... I got to look at my notes, 31 known meetups, accessibility meetups.

50
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,020
I say known because I'm finding about ...  finding out about new meetups every day.

51
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,620
I just found out about one in Oslo yesterday.

52
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,980
How many people here are members of North American meetups? Raise your hands.

53
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,480
Okay, how about International?

54
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Oslo, yes!

55
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,460
But I mean, there are meetups, accessibility meetups all over the globe.

56
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,160
I mean we have them in India, we have them in Australia,

57
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,180
even in New Zealand, although it's not as active as that might have thought.

58
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,440
The oldest ... now this is going to get controversial.

59
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,200
[Laughter]

60
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:32,060
[Dennis]: The oldest accessibility meetup is the Sydney accessibility meetup, which was founded in 2010.

61
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,780
The controversy because I've been told I'm wrong within the last two days.

62
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,400
But for now I'm going with that.

63
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,720
The youngest is one that was just started last month in Dublin, Ireland.

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,360
The largest, I am proud to say, is the one in Chicago, Illinois,

65
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,740
and the smallest, again, just starting last month, is the one in Dublin.

66
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,840
The average size for accessibility meetups tends to be about 480 people.

67
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,620
Did you have anything to add to that?

68
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,920
[Billy]: No ...

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,840
... I didn't know you had past Toronto, so we'll see how long you stay the largest.

70
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,780
[Laughter]

71
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,260
[Dennis]: Okay, can I say, there is a competitive aspect to this.

72
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,640
There's a reason ... it's not just for ego
and stuff like that.

73
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,420
It's actually the larger we get, the more attractive we are to sponsors,

74
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,740
which means we can have ... offer richer meetups and events.

75
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,000
[Billy]: Absolutely.

76
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:41,500
So, my question to you ... you didn't actually create or start the Toronto meetup,

77
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,440
but how did you get started with it?

78
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,320
[Billy]: So I just ... I didn't create it,

79
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,820
Jennison Asuncion actually created the Toronto Accessibility meetup with George Zamfir.

80
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,320
I was present at sort of the first meetup,

81
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,580
and I was sort of hovering around them like a little fan boy for the first half dozen or so.

82
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,100
I actually helped them find the first perfect meetup location,

83
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,900
so I've sort of been indirectly involved with their organization since Day One.

84
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:12,780
But I started to stumble into a GAAD event and it was actually the first a11yTO meetup,

85
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,900
corresponding to the first ever Global Accessibility Awareness Day.

86
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,900
I guess Jennison was just in the launching stuff kind of mood.

87
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,020
[Dennis]: As he does.

88
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,240
[Billy]: Yeah, so he'd launched both of them on the same day. I was there.

89
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,800
and then when Jennison quit Canada, I took over for him.

90
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:40,320
But just it back up a little bit about one oldest meetup, we should single out John Croston in the room,

91
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,220
who actually ran one of the first accessibility camps and meetup groups in the Washington DC area, so ...

92
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,000
John is actually like the Godfather of all of our groups.

93
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,780
[John]: Thank you, sir.

94
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,280
[Billy]: Proper credit.

95
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,100
[Dennis]: The only reason why I did not announce him as being the oldest is because

96
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,560
he didn't respond to the survey I sent out just before the event.

97
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,260
And of course, I have no memory whatsoever.

98
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:13,860
So, I started the Chicago meetup out of pure selfishness.

99
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:23,460
At the time, four years ago, I was working for a major airline located in the Chicago area

100
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,640
who flies the friendly skies ... say no more.

101
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,840
And of course, with Airlines, we needed ...

102
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:37,360
we were mandated by the Department of Transportation to be accessible within three years.

103
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,640
So I wanted to latch on.

104
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,900
I actually wanted to move into UX from front-end development, and I saw that as my bridge.

105
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,200
Since then, of course, I've decided to stay in the bridge, because I like that more than anything else.

106
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:59,580
But, I looked around for six months for an accessibility meetup in the Chicago area.

107
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,460
And since I couldn't find any, as they say, create it yourself.

108
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:14,080
So, on the day after Christmas, in a shopping outlet mall, while my wife was shopping,

109
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,960
I'm in the car, creating the Chicago Meetup on meetup.com.

110
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,620
And sort of the rest is history.

111
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,700
Been loving it ever since.

112
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,320
So, how to start and grow an accessibility meetup?

113
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,020
I say the first thing you need to do is just do it.

114
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,540
If you have no accessibility meetup in your local area, create one.

115
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:44,180
I mean I'm not going to promote meetup.com and they're a great platform, there's other ways to do it.

116
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,640
I know John has used Eventbrite.

117
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,280
Do it how ever works for you.

118
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,520
The advice that we're giving, hopefully I'm not speaking for you, but the advice you're giving his work for us,

119
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:05,820
and we want to share with everyone, but you'll find that in your area, in your locale, different things work.

120
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:12,280
For instance, in Sydney Australia, they have their meetups in the morning, before work,

121
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,560
and that works great for them.

122
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,340
I never would have thought of it, but as I learn more about them, that's interesting.

123
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:28,920
The one thing, and John can attest to this, you should be up here ... is that you're going to need help.

124
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,960
[John]: Yes.

125
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,300
[Billy]: You need a team.

126
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
[Dennis]: You need a team.

127
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,940
You can't do it alone.

128
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,320
I did it alone for almost three years and it was a lot of hard work.

129
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:47,800
And I desperately looked for assistance to help based on their areas of strength.

130
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,160
I brought on someone who's strong with social media.

131
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,420
now they handle all the social media stuff.

132
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,380
I handled ... brought on someone who handles events, who does very well with events.

133
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:09,960
This morning, I introduced a new co-organizer, who's going to bring a wealth of richness to our meetup.

134
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,580
So, you just have to have help and it's okay. In fact it engages your membership.

135
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,580
[Billy]: Absolutely that was something we acknowledged pretty early on once we took off.

136
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,040
We had this sort of revolving door of co-orgs at a11yTO.

137
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,100
One, because people move on. It's impossible to think that somebody can start a meetup and stay with it forever.

138
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,220
It's an unrealistic expectation that anyone can donate that much of their life for that long.

139
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,040
Because these do take a lot of time.

140
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,060
I would estimate I'd probably spend a couple of thousand man-hours a year of my own time,

141
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,460
on my own dime, organizing these events.

142
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,240
So we added a number of people to our team a while back

143
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,400
and actually, now that we have our conference in Toronto as well,

144
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,820
which is under a11yTO, Oscar and I, who are the two co-orgs,

145
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,500
have actually stopped or stepped back from organizing the monthly events.

146
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,300
We hand that over to Lisa Folkerson and Nell Chitty of Toronto and they're doing a fantastic job

147
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,760
They've introduced a whole bunch of ... sort of networking kind of games to keep things fresh.

148
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,720
Like they did accessibility speed dating at one of our events.

149
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,120
So it's just like speed networking. So basically every minute or two you would move on to a new person,

150
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,620
it's just a way to sort of make the group interact with each other.

151
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:31,300
So, you know, just keeping things fresh. I think we have a game of accessibility "Never have I ever" coming up.

152
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,120
Which I mean you can think of the things that you had never seen

153
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,580
or whatever when looking at it terribly inaccessible website.

154
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:44,340
So we always try to find new ways of getting the ... forcing the members to interact with each other.

155
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,200
[Dennis]: How many organizers do you need ... to help out?

156
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,320
It just depends. I think if you have one it's better than none.

157
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,920
We found that on average most meetups have about three total organizers,

158
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
And I think that, obviously that works.

159
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,360
There's some that have seven and there's several that only have one.

160
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,560
And I would just say that if you only have one ...

161
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,940
[John]: Get help.

162
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,280
[Dennis]: Get Help.

163
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,880
Get that support.

164
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,620
How have you gotten the word out about the Toronto meetup?

165
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,660
[Billy]: I think we're pretty lucky in Toronto in that we have a very rich community.

166
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,520
There's a lot of developers there and the camp definitely helps get word out about the meetups.

167
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,580
And we're just we sort of have this built-in interest in the city.

168
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,800
So I mean, we spam a lot on Twitter. We're very, you know, active on social media.

169
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,120
We're not afraid to pay that extra $10 to boost a Facebook post

170
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
or whatever we need to do to get more people out.

171
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,160
But we also try to keep the events fresh enough that it brings new people all the time

172
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,120
and we're lucky in that we have our core set of regulars that come out all the time,

173
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,460
and then we have ... we always see new faces.

174
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,140
So about 50% of every meetup is new people, which is pretty awesome.

175
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,600
Hopefully they come back.

176
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,220
[Audience member]: You mentioned Twitter. I just wanted to say,

177
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,960
if your active on Twitter and you have an accessibility meetup or you're looking for one,

178
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:27,160
WebAxe has an access meetup list, a Twiiter list. So, it has a bunch of accessibility meetup twitters on the list.

179
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,600
So, if you want to check that out, or let me know if you want to be on that list.

180
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,780
[Billy]: Cool. So for those who couldn't hear Dennis, he said on the WebAxe dot com? Dot org?

181
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,600
[Audience Member]: Well, on Twitter.

182
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,940
[Billy]: Oh, on Twitter. So Twitter. Follow him, he's got a list of accessibility meetup groups,

183
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,620
so you can look there or you can ...

184
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,460
[Dennis]: I'm going to selfishly ask you about ...

185
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,480
recently on Twitter, you started adding these graphics.

186
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,980
[Billy]: Yeah ...

187
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,740
[Dennis]: They're very eye catching and I think that's one of the benefits.

188
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,560
Can you just tell a little story about ... the insight as to why you went in that direction?

189
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,300
[Billy]: We added a wonderfully talented woman named Nell Chitty to our team.

190
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,200
And the first thing she did was say "your social media sucks! I want to do this."

191
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,040
So she just started adding all of these graphics, just to make things pop out a little bit.

192
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,020
It actually started around the time we did conference,

193
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,260
because we needed to sell tickets, in order to afford it.

194
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,220
So she started adding all these little graphics and then we just went with it.

195
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,080
We were like, you had just take over social media and do what you need to do, this is fantastic.

196
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,560
So that's worked out well.

197
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,800
Now I think she actually just released like a little, and actual little video, I think for one of our last meetups.

198
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,920
So she's, yeah, she's just doing all kinds of great stuff.

199
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:55,840
[Dennis]: We started ... I'm a Twitterhead, always have been, as long as I've been doing web stuff.

200
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,320
And I was doing the social media for the first couple years.

201
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,080
I think for me it was more about frequency than quality.

202
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,220
Which is why I have someone taking over it now.

203
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,900
But basically I use Twitter for everything, for promotion, for awareness, as well as building our membership.

204
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,500
I have used, shamelessly, Twitter Advanced Search,

205
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:28,000
to follow, from the meetup account, as many digital professionals in Chicago as I can find.

206
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,520
And what I have found is a third of those follow us back,

207
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:37,660
which means now they're getting our promotional tweets and other tweets,

208
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,960
and maybe third to a half of those actually joining our meetup.

209
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,900
So social media, for us, has been very helpful.

210
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:51,760
Now since that has started, I would say now word-of-mouth is really picking up.

211
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,160
I mean people who attend are now telling their co-workers

212
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,700
and now I see those co-workers attending the next meetup.

213
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,620
[Billy]: It's great to see things grow organically like that.

214
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,800
But yet don't ... the best thing you could probably be is shameless

215
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,320
when it comes to promoting and growing and looking for new ways to you know build your following.

216
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,240
[Dennis]: If you think of it, we're all passionate about accessibility.

217
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:24,360
So just evangelize it and have as many other people in your community, meetup community evangelize for you as well.

218
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,800
Venues.

219
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,860
[Billy]: This is always a fun one.

220
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,860
[Dennis]: Venues, Billy ...

221
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,860
[Billy]: Remember what I said, be shameless?

222
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,220
Be Shameless.

223
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Like if you meet somebody, like when I'm not when I'm at events and I'm meeting people for the first time,

224
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm like, hey, what brings you out and where you work, how big is the office,

225
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,540
have you ever thought about hosting one of these, here's my card, let's go, you know.

226
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:54,300
But honestly, you just ask and that's the easiest way to do it.

227
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,080
Everybody that comes out, we put out emails all the time, little tweets,

228
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,800
but we actually just ask people face-to-face, where do you work?

229
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,000
Would you be interested in hosting something like this?

230
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,260
We've got a couple of folks that offer us sort of a standing invite too,

231
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,540
but we try to move around as much as possible, just to keep things fresh.

232
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,520
It's also a little easier to get people out when your in different areas of the city,

233
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,460
because its not always easy to get somebody out across town at 5pm or 6pm.

234
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,600
So we try to move from one end of the city as much as we can.

235
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:33,700
[Dennis]: In Chicago, we started in a bar ... which was fun, except for when we wanted to do

236
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,480
any sort of talk or presentation, you couldn't hear.

237
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,980
Which is , obviously ... which success criteria is that again? Audio Contrast, I don't know ...

238
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,140
[Laughter]

239
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,420
[Billy]: Did he just invent a new success criteria?

240
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,560
[Dennis]: But luckily enough, after the second event at the bar,

241
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:08,340
we had someone from Razorfish, who said "Hey, I can put you in our conference room, after hours."

242
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,600
And, basically, the rest is history after that..

243
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,560
We've worked with various groups, individuals and not ...

244
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
So, one thing I would say is ...

245
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,460
even though it's slightly dealing with the devil, sometimes, as you might look at it,

246
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,580
look for a recruitment firm.

247
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:37,760
They love to have their talent, UX, developers, and stuff, come in to their organization

248
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,660
if they have the facilities, they would be more than happy to host your event.

249
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,660
Now, there's pros and cons ... they're going to want to sell ...

250
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,880
so you will have to manage that, maybe, depending on the recruitment firm.

251
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,440
But that's one way to sort of "get in," if you're having problems.

252
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:01,300
[Billy]: Schools, dev shops, those little bootcamp ... we have an organization in Toronto called Hacker U.

253
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,100
They offer us their classrooms after hours as well, so there's always opportunities.

254
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,420
You just have to dig a little bit.

255
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,640
You ran out of a library?

256
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,860
[John Croston III]: We ran for the first 4 or 5 years out of a public library.

257
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,280
And now we're at Blackboard, we're there all the time.

258
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,700
[Audience member]: Seattle too.

259
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
[John Croston III]: Seattle is out of a library too.

260
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,960
[Billy]: So libraries are an option, any kind of public space.

261
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,060
[Dennis]: The one thing I will say is, you might feel relieved once you've found a venue,

262
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,220
but please make sure they're accessible.

263
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,400
Go, actually do a scouting and check it out.

264
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,280
Make sure that they offer all the facilities for accessibility.

265
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,500
Make sure they have good audio, visual equipment.

266
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,740
Funny enough, right now, one of our requirements is, we need to have two screens, two monitors.

267
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,560
One for the presentation, one for live captions.

268
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,340
We'll get into it later, but we live stream everything.

269
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,720
So we provide live captioning along with our event.

270
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,460
And yes, of course, good Wi-Fi.

271
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,900
I'm actually finding that that is more difficult than I would have thought.

272
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,020
You want to make sure that, obviously, the presenter needs Wi-Fi.

273
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:23,080
If you're doing something special with live captioning, you might need a separate network for that,

274
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
a good, fast network for that.

275
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,840
And also consider your participants, your attendees,

276
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,340
who might need Wi-Fi, let's say, if they're accessing live captioning from other means.

277
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,620
So, definitely want to look at those as you look at venues for your meetup.

278
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,760
Speakers

279
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
[Billy]: This is a fun one.

280
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,700
So we took a different approach in Toronto last year.

281
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,020
We actually put together a curriculum,

282
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:55,020
and then we started thinking about who would be best to deliver on that specific topic.

283
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:01,980
So we sort of planned our year, decided which topics we wanted, and then sort of approached people on that.

284
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,120
Now there's always going to be someone who's coming through town.

285
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,100
Like if a Lainey Feingold comes through your town, you drop everything and you set up a meetup

286
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,100
because you know you're going to get 200 people out for that.

287
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,960
So, there's the special guest, for the most part, like if Adrian's coming through town,

288
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
that's a good 15 people right there.

289
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,240
[Laughter]

290
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
[Comments from the audience]

291
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,680
So we can book like the public restroom or something for him ...

292
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,720
[Laughter]

293
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,360
But its ... there's always special events that we do.

294
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,160
At Toronto, we're a big social town, we love our social events.

295
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,860
If we book a social event at a bar, on a days notice, we'll fill it.

296
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,560
I guess Canadians just love their beer.

297
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,940
But we're really fortunate ... [indecipherable]

298
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,600
Finding speakers, we approach ... we're shameless ...

299
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:01,520
[Dennis]: It's funny because, actually, two years ago, is when I discovered that,

300
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,500
having well-known speakers, traveling through your city.

301
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,820
Derek Featherstone was the first individual. He was speaking at An Event Apart

302
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,760
I shamelessly just said, "Hey, while you're in town, can you speak at our meetup."

303
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,060
And he said, "Sure."

304
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:25,280
I've had the same thing happen with Lainey. And with Marcy Sutton. It's great.

305
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,460
But it also doesn't stop with in-person speakers.

306
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,400
We've had Laura Kalbag from Sweden present remotely.

307
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:43,260
So, you are in a locale that doesn't get the celebrities if you want to say, coming through town,

308
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,040
always consider going the remote route.

309
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,800
Yes?

310
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:54,960
[Attendee]: Hi, I'm from Dallas, and my friend and I are wanting to start a meetup.

311
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,420
Do speakers expect monetary ... ?

312
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,280
[Billy]: We've never had anyone ask us for money.

313
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,140
I think, most of the time, folks know that if their coming to speak at a small meetup group,

314
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,160
there's not going to be money. Best case, you take them out to dinner afterwards.

315
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,340
[Dennis]: And I have to get good at actually buying them a beer afterwards.

316
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,140
I'm typically the first one out, catching the train.

317
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,960
I need to get better.

318
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,600
So, yes, very good question on that.

319
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,300
I've actually toyed with ... if we got enough sponsorship, maybe there would be some nominal payment.

320
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,600
I think that would be more valuable for our local speakers.

321
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,240
To say, "Thanks for all the effort you put into this."

322
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,700
And then, I think, you know, obviously, you have your celebrity speakers, your local speakers

323
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:55,500
I am very much looking at taking individuals from our meetup

324
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,460
who I know have skills, knowledge and experience,

325
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:05,420
and trying to encourage them, almost mentoring them to speak at our meetups.

326
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,120
Just this year, I have already picked out four individuals who I've said, "I want you to work on something."

327
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,900
"I want you to work on something for later this year."

328
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:23,860
Because I think it does resonate well with the attendees, that someone in their midst, look what they're doing.

329
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:30,300
And that might actually create more connections and networking opportunities for that speaker,

330
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,320
to share their knowledge.

331
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Ok, Formats.

332
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,300
[Billy]: These are fun.

333
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,960
We have a few different formats in Toronto.

334
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,120
We generally stick with either a social event, so there is no speaker whatsoever,

335
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,020
we just take over a top floor of a pub, and we just network and socialize,

336
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,120
we have our one speaker-type meetup, where they come and present on something,

337
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,040
and then, interestingly enough, our two biggest events of the year, I don't now why,

338
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,160
the two biggest events that we always have is,

339
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,320
we always kick off the year with sort of an introductory, sort of accessibility 101 panel,

340
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,860
that's always rammed.

341
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,060
And then for some reason, the week after CSUN, we usually do a CSUN wrap-up.

342
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,160
And that was always rammed as well. And those are general panels.

343
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,400
And then literally anything with the letters UX in it.

344
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,480
[Dennis]: Yeah, what is it with UX?

345
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,480
[Billy]: I don't know.

346
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:35,720
[Dennis]: It's funny. Presentations have worked well for us.

347
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:43,140
Because I have a sort of training and awareness mindset, that's the direction I've normally gone in.

348
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,920
But I am looking, and we're talking about keeping it fresh in a little bit here,

349
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
we are looking to mix it up.

350
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,760
I know for Global Accessibility Awareness Day, to your point, having a speed dating format,

351
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:04,640
we're looking at having an empathy event, where we'll have groups of individuals with various disabilities

352
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:12,720
and groups of attendees will visit these stations, the verbiage here is off the top of my head,

353
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
we haven't fully planned it out yet.

354
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:21,340
But basically, attendees would interact with individuals with disabilities

355
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:30,140
and learn about how their work, their thinking impacts those individuals.

356
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,400
And after ten, fifteen minutes, whistle blows, people switch stations.

357
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,620
And, there's been a lot of excitement within our organizers of this event.

358
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,620
So, I'm looking to see how that plays out.

359
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,380
[Billy]: That sounds good.

360
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,260
[Dennis]: Demonstrations I have down here.

361
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,180
I know next month, we're looking ...

362
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:57,360
So, screen readers are actually very popular, but most people are not aware of other assistive technology.

363
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,260
So we're having an event where, we're doing two different demos.

364
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:09,180
One of them is for refreshable braille display, which most of our membership is completely unaware of.

365
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,480
But then, hopefully this works out,

366
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:20,880
we're having someone come in and to discuss assistive technology for individuals with cognitive disabilities.

367
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:29,380
Jamie Knight said he would remote in, and now he's talking he might actually be in town

368
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,020
I'm like, "you gotta be kidding me."

369
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:42,640
So I'm trying to keep my enthusiasm down, because if that all comes about, I will be a kid in a candy store.

370
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,080
[Billy]: Oh yeah, and so, in an other life, I used to promote professional wrestling shows.

371
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,620
[Dennis]: which feeds into this perfectly.

372
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,740
[Laughter]

373
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,120
[Billy]: You can snicker, but the logic behind this is,

374
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,340
on the pro wrestling circuit, if you have a big name wrestler, and you wanted to bring them to your event,

375
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:07,620
what you would do is find other promoters in cities close by, and you would share in that initial travel cost.

376
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:14,720
So, you get four or five meetups that are close together, and then you can pay the cost of flights or whatever

377
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,200
to bring this person over. So that's another option; if you know someone coming through town,

378
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,460
if Jamie was coming to Chicago, then I might think about flying him up to Toronto,

379
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,520
because it's only an hour or so by plane, we could split some of the costs or whatever.

380
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,620
So, there's always options to sort of share, split costs between sister cities

381
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,920
If you're running in Dallas, I know that Austin has a group, which isn't that far away.

382
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,220
[Dennis]: Sponsors

383
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,040
I might just look straight to you and find out how you do sponsors.

384
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,740
[Billy]: Be Shameless.

385
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,620
[Laughter]

386
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,700
[Dennis]: Again

387
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,320
[Billy]: Literally, I am just ruthless when it comes to begging for money.

388
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,900
I call in every favor. Anybody I ask, they get added to our meetup mailing list.

389
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,280
Johnny Taylor, you've probably seen him in a couple of slide decks this week, in my talk, in Heni's talk,

390
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,540
he actually looks after a lot of our sponsorship stuff.

391
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,560
So he's the guy, just at home, spamming people ...

392
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,260
and it's not spam, these are personal, boilerplate emails that we send out to everybody.

393
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,280
It's got everyone's name on it, not just [name] in brackets or anything.

394
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:30,360
But we're pretty ruthless about it. We call in favors.

395
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,060
We have sort of an attractive tiered sponsorship.

396
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,440
And that's one thing that worked well for us. We introduced sponsorship tiers a couple of years ago.

397
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,060
Just as a ... maybe it would work.

398
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:46,300
And people loved it. The sponsors saw more value in that,

399
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,840
because they got more space, there was more perks,

400
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,820
we added different value options or value adds as you went up a level.

401
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,220
And we run pretty big events.

402
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,900
On average, get about 60 or 70 people out for each meetup that we have host.

403
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,900
Socials are about 50 to 60.

404
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,140
We have a yearly camp that we bring, well, we ...

405
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:18,240
300 people and this we'll tell you in a slide later,  300 people signup but 200 people show.

406
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,420
No shows are something you'll just need to deal with when you're running a meetup group.

407
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,080
And then now we have conference too.

408
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,660
So we sort of introduced, instead of "hey sponsor this event' or "sponsor camp,"

409
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,880
we have "sponsor a11yTO for the year, and you're going to get all of this.

410
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,740
If you're interested in sponsorship opportunities ...

411
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,200
[Laughter]

412
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,940
[Billy]: you can talk to me after the event.

413
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,900
[Dennis]: Shameless plug

414
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,720
[Billy]: I'm more than happy to discuss sponsorship with any of you.

415
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,000
Except you.

416
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,880
[Laughter]

417
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,540
[Billy]: Question?

418
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:55,480
[Attendee]: A coupe of things that have worked very well, one ties back to the venue.

419
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:04,200
My agency hosts the Detroit UX Meetup ... [indecipherable]

420
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
[Dennis]: Im going to do this ...

421
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,540
[Billy]: I was hoping you'd just lean in.

422
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,780
[Laughter]

423
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:19,660
[Attendee]: So, I am a member of Accessibility Meetup groups and the Detroit UX meetup group...

424
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:25,860
... and when host, when my agency hosts meetups, the agency itself offers swag,

425
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,240
so there's cool stuff sitting around for people to have.

426
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:39,440
The really valuable one though is O'Reilly Publishers and Rosenfeld Media both have user group chapters,

427
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,860
that they provide free books for.

428
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,980
So you can get e-books and physical books to give away at events.

429
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,940
[Dennis]: Actually, that's a good point.

430
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,740
I have done that with A Book Apart as well.

431
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,940
Rosenfeld Media is one of our sponsors and they offer us a discount,

432
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,540
as well as books, free books for special occasions.

433
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,860
The only thing I am going to say about sponsors is ...

434
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:15,380
we're planning ... we're working on a day-long accessibility camp in Chicago for the first time this year.

435
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:15,880
[Billy]: Whoo!

436
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,880
[Applause]

437
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,380
But, and I am not a sponsor ... unlike Billy, I am not one to go out there and say "please give us money."

438
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,380
But, I personally feel, if you can show the benefit and the value to the sponsor,

439
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,560
it's easier than you may think.

440
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,100
So, just consider and think about that.

441
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:45,640
Yes, and wait one moment, I just want to make sure you can be heard by everyone.

442
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,980
Audience member]: So, both of you talked about providing value to the sponsors,

443
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,980
and sponsorship tiers, Billy.

444
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:01,120
Can you be more specific about the kinds of benefits that you offer to sponsors?

445
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:08,680
[Billy]: Yes, so, as a small meetup site, camp, conference, whatever, we don't have a lot to offer,

446
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,000
other than, visibility.

447
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,380
So, certain levels of sponsorship might get you on all of our printed materials that we hand out.

448
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,660
It would be on our website.

449
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,580
Social media callouts.

450
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,520
The frequency and number. Whether or not you have access to our database afterwards.

451
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,560
Not to ... no to, we never give away our information.

452
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,340
But we will include a message from a sponsor in a wrap-up email or something.

453
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:37,600
We will never allow the sponsors direct access to our members, because that's just gross.

454
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,760
But we will definitely pass along any messages.

455
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,980
So its really just, figure out what value you can offer them,

456
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,560
and then just multiply that offering by how ever many tiers you want to give up.

457
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,420
[Dennis]: Exactly.

458
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:58,640
We have 5 more minutes. So ... I'm sorry, one more question, and then we have to move on.

459
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,980
[Audience member]: I want to know about, how often to you communicate via email with your membership,

460
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,980
and what types of email you send out?

461
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,980
[Billy]: Ah, daily. No, just kidding ...

462
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,880
[Laughter]

463
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,940
[Billy]: I sent four emails since I've been up here. Just checking in. How's your day? You know ...

464
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,620
You miss me?

465
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:29,180
No, usually we use it just for announcing events, or, we use social media a lot.

466
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,900
Like, social media, we'll just tweet things that we find interesting, or retweet things.

467
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,020
As far as announcing meetups, we try to keep that to just one or two.

468
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,500
A lot of the time, before wait-list only or something, we might send out another email,

469
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,860
just saying, "hey, if you can't make it now, maybe you should think about changing your RSVPs,

470
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,860
so somebody else can get your spot."

471
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,300
It's kind of a ...

472
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:56,320
not so secret, secret in Toronto that, if the event's full, just show up, because we don't take attendance,

473
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:02,040
we don't check anyone off, and there's always more than enough no-shows that you can sneak in.

474
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,800
[John Croston III] As long as you get by security.

475
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,040
[Billy]: We have no security.

476
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,740
[John Croston III] ... we need four forms ...

477
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,060
[Billy]: Well this isn't your talk, John.

478
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,440
[Laughter]

479
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,080
[Dennis]: But to that point, in Chicago, most of the venues that we use, require building security.

480
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,480
So we have a two-day lead time for cutoffs.

481
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,480
So anyone that says, "Hey, I just noticed ..."

482
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,440
I have to say, I'm sorry. I mean, if you can get through building security, that's on you.

483
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,240
[Billy]: Challenge accepted!

484
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,740
[Dennis]: But guess what ... people have done it. Oh ... need to talk about building security.

485
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,340
We need to move forward ...

486
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,880
To Stream or Not to Stream

487
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,020
Billy, that is the question.

488
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,320
[Billy]: We do not stream. We've dabbled with it.

489
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:56,940
We've had minimal success. And we just don't have the technology at hand to do it in a reliable way.

490
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,560
We do have live captioning for all of our events. So if you're there, you can follow captions.

491
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,380
But we tend to steer away from sharing the content outside of the event.

492
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,180
So there are sort of special one off events and then they're just gone.

493
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,040
So we never made the decision not to stream.

494
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,280
[Dennis]: We live stream almost all of our events.

495
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:24,340
And of course, the question at each time, when we only get 30, 40 percent attendance is ...

496
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,020
is it the stream that's doing it?

497
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:34,700
I actually ran a test recently with an accessibility clinic format, where there was no live stream.

498
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,960
And no recording.

499
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,600
And it did not impact attendance at all.

500
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,120
So I was like, "Ok, cool."

501
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,100
I tend to want to live stream because I want to create awareness.

502
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,100
I mean, some of our sponsorship has been due to, getting that word out.

503
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,240
So, I don't wish to hurt that.

504
00:36:52,240 --> 00:37:00,660
I do know that a lot of other accessibility organizers feel that it can cannibalize their in-person attendance

505
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,160
as well as they want that face-to-face recognition.

506
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,400
So it really just depends on your scenario, what you like to do.

507
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,800
Live captioning and American Sign Language

508
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,780
[Billy]: Yes.

509
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,260
If you are running an inclusive event, you need this. It's the bottom line.

510
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:25,240
ASL, we have on request. If somebody says I need this, we'll have it.

511
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,040
We try to find discreet ways of asking, if somebody needs it.

512
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,940
At our Camps and at our Conference, it's just there. We don't ask anybody if they need it, it's just there.

513
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,680
And live captioning is without a doubt, 100 percent always going to be there.

514
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,840
Because you can't have an inclusive event if it's not inclusive.

515
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,180
[Dennis]: Same here, if I couldn't offer live captioning I probably wouldn't live stream that event.

516
00:37:52,940 --> 00:38:02,260
For special events, especially for those where participants would be hard of hearing or deaf,

517
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,780
we do have sign language interpreters there.

518
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Again, its all about budget, it's all making sure you can cover it with your sponsorships.

519
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Keeping it fresh.

520
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,280
I think I already mentioned how I'm looking into it. Anything you'd like to add to that?

521
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,140
[Billy]: Yeah, so one interesting challenge we had was somebody said,

522
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,840
and I'm tipping my hat here, so this is just between us and Twitter, ok?

523
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,820
We're introducing something new in Toronto coming up.

524
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,460
Because we had a bunch of business folks, we call them the train crowd,

525
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,960
that basically have to get out of the city at 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock

526
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,840
They've got kids, they've got families, they can't stick around for a meetup.

527
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,340
So, we had somebody suggest, "well, why can't you do something during the day?"

528
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,660
So we are introducing something that is geared more towards corporate clients or people who can't get out,

529
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,220
and we are introducing what we are going to be calling the lunch meet.

530
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,220
I think it's a very funny name. Oskar Westin came up with that.

531
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:08,720
But a11yTO is going to start running lunch hour meetups at organizations, and we're going to stream those

532
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,140
for everybody else who can't make it. So that's something we're going to be doing probably in May.

533
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,480
[Dennis]: Ok, hold on. I gotta write that down.

534
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,260
[Billy]: Don't worry, I'll schedule it. don't worry.

535
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,680
[Dennis]: That's fantastic.

536
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,680
I can't really add anything to that. I told you, we're looking at speed dating formats.

537
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,140
It's basically as ideas come about. The speed dating format came from Twitter.

538
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:38,380
[Billy]: I think it came from the guy beside you. Doesn't that sound familiar?

539
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,320
[Dennis faux whispering to Billy]

540
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,820
[Dennis]: Attendance

541
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,440
I think we, I mean, it's just a pain point.

542
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,420
Oversell. I used to work for an airline. It works. Fill up planes, fill up your meetup.

543
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,580
This is hard to see because it's not actually meant as information,

544
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:03,660
but this was a meetup that Marcy Sutton presented at.

545
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,640
We had one hundred twenty seven RSVPs.

546
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
We had thirty three people show up.

547
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,240
And that's normal.

548
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,160
[Billy]: Yeah, that's not uncommon to have ... fifty percent drop off is normal.

549
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:23,980
And, it's not uncommon to have a butt ton of people say, yeah I want to come out and then have a handful.

550
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,340
I mean, life happens, right?

551
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,080
It's at night, anything can happen.

552
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,140
You might be stuck late at work. You might have a problem with your children.

553
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:35,800
You might just say ... [indecipherable] ... oh, it's my hair, sorry.

554
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:42,400
[Dennis]: We're actually over, but you got time for one story, and I have time for one story.

555
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,800
[Billy]: Geez, why don't you do your story first, I have too many stories.

556
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,140
[Dennis]: As ... starting with the ...

557
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,620
meetup events, I've always looked for them to be as accessible as possible.

558
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:03,860
In doing so, if you are more able bodied than others, you're going to make mistakes.

559
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,860
And you'll learn from those mistakes.

560
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:13,660
We had events where I dimmed the lights, so this way, the screen could be seen better.

561
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,200
Unfortunately, the individuals who were hard of hearing or deaf

562
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,080
could not read lips when we did not have captions.

563
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,420
That was a great bit of information. But I felt awful.

564
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:36,100
Same thing happened for one of our events, we had a live stream going, we went over, I shut down the stream,

565
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,180
the individual next to me was going "hey, what happened to the stream?"

566
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,260
He was looking at live captions. I said ah, crap.

567
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,100
So it took me about five more minutes to get it connected.

568
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,940
Anything?

569
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,300
[Billy]: I've definitely had the same pain points you've had.

570
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,240
But I want to build off this.

571
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,120
I think ...

572
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,760
one of the fun things you can do with these events is to look for others ways to engage the community.

573
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:04,560
So, find another thing that might tie in to your overall message, and find a new, fun way to present it.

574
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:10,460
We had a professional wrestler at ... I'm mixing my worlds here now ...

575
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,820
but we had a professional wrestler at our last camp, who had been bullied all his life, because he is a little person.

576
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,280
And he found that by putting on a mask and being a wrestler,

577
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,020
it was his way of combating basically his disability.

578
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,140
So he came and did a little talk about that, and then the best part was,

579
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,200
he put Jennison Asuncion on his shoulders and did ten squats.

580
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,200
[Laughter]

581
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,280
[Billy]: That was fun. Oh and then he threw him down to the ground and pinned him.

582
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,660
Jennison is no longer the champion of accessibility, It's a young man named Kid Canuck from Toronto, Ontario.

583
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:51,400
[Dennis]: Just before we wrap up, if you jotted down the URL for this deck, we have a few resources.

584
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,320
One is a list of accessibility and inclusive design meetup groups,

585
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:03,800
which is regularly maintained by an individual in Detroit Michigan, so you might want to check that one out.

586
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,540
I recently did an accessibility meetup survey for organizers.

587
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:15,340
So basically a lot of the same information that we shared today is there in this one page report.

588
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:22,520
And then the last three are documents that my meetup has created as far as

589
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:29,200
a venues checklist for accessibility, accessible presentations guide for presenters,

590
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:35,760
how to create accessible presentations, how to ensure you're repeating the questions, things like that,

591
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:42,720
and then social media, basically how to create accessible tweets and such.

592
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,700
With that said, we thank you for attending.

593
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,460
[Applause]

## Derek Featherstone- Tuesday, August 29, 2017
[Source recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jYqddfcNeA)

**[Dennis]:** Please give a warm, Chicago welcome, to Derek Featherstone.

**[Applause]**

**[Derek]:** This is a little scary because I have a microphone and a lapel microphone and my presentation remote ... I don't know how this is gonna work. I also like to walk around a lot. I am ready to trip over the cord at some point.

So, I am feather on Twitter if you want to reach out to me there connect there I'd be happy to hear from you. I've got open DMs and like almost nobody sends me DMs. So, like please, send me please not all at the same time though. If you want to connect, feel free to email as well, or you can if you want to get in touch about something you have a question, go to our website simplyaccessible.com, and you can go to the contact page and have a form there and that goes into not just me. I tend to travel quite a bit so it's easier when that that message comes to everybody because then they all know what to do with it while I'm still traveling. I going to be gone the rest of the week in Toronto, so I won't be checking in nearly as much, so feel free to connect, I'd love to hear from you and I just I like talking to people. So it's kind of fun when when you send me messages, just don't get mad if I don't send it back right away.

0:01:57.060,0:02:01.920
Alright, this is a gentleman named Henry Butler,

0:02:01.920,0:02:03.920
and he is a jazz pianist.

0:02:04.600,0:02:12.600
And one of the things that was sort of a really incredible experience for me

0:02:12.600,0:02:17.540
was going to this performance that Henry was part of called Sight, Sound, Soul.

0:02:17.540,0:02:26.300
And it happened in Austin Texas and it was probably the most inclusive event that I've ever been to.

0:02:26.300,0:02:29.160
It was amazingly incredible.

0:02:29.160,0:02:36.060
They had taken into account accessibility from as many different perspectives as you as you could imagine.

0:02:37.020,0:02:43.340
It didn't stop at the ... to have a physically accessible space

0:02:43.600,0:02:48.360
and we're going to make sure that we have captioning for the performance,

0:02:48.760,0:02:51.760
they actually went beyond that, and I'd like  to share some of that with you.

0:02:51.760,0:03:00.360
Now this is ... it was in an old barn type building, but it was redone

0:03:00.360,0:03:03.540
and it was all refinished inside, it was very accessible.

0:03:03.540,0:03:07.920
And there was loads of people there, it was quite, quite an incredible experience

0:03:07.920,0:03:10.200
to see that many people come to this performance.

0:03:10.740,0:03:16.840
And again, it's called Sight Sounds Soul, which is really kind of this mysterious intriguing thing,

0:03:16.840,0:03:18.840
like what is what does this actually mean?

0:03:19.500,0:03:27.860
And this is the theme. It's not just about Henry, although he's the primary performer.

0:03:28.160,0:03:32.980
There's a number of other pieces that are part of the performance.

0:03:33.340,0:03:38.280
So you can see Henry here sitting at his piano with his back to the audience.

0:03:38.280,0:03:41.540
He's got his sunglasses on he actually looks really cool.

0:03:41.540,0:03:47.060
It's a red kind of velvet suit, which I think is appropriate for a jazz pianist.

0:03:47.300,0:03:50.240
There's also an ASL interpreter there

0:03:50.580,0:03:57.180
and there is also a person that is doing live captions sitting down next to the ASL interpreter

0:03:57.400,0:04:02.040
and sitting down next to the live captioner is an audio describer.

0:04:03.640,0:04:06.720
They have really taken a lot into account here.

0:04:06.720,0:04:12.780
And it this I'm going to just share it with you and because when I was living this experience,

0:04:13.280,0:04:15.860
it kind of blew my mind how inclusive it was.

0:04:15.860,0:04:22.720
So I'm gonna let it play and for those of you they can't see it, there will be an audio description of it coming,

0:04:22.720,0:04:28.220
So I asked you to just kind of be patient, it's a couple of slides after this a little bit of the performance,

0:04:28.220,0:04:32.580
or it's actually the next slide after this performance, so you'll get an audio description almost right away.

0:04:40.740,0:04:42.940
So you might need to check the volume on this.

0:04:43.800,0:06:00.720
[Piano Music]

0:06:00.720,0:06:05.800
[Derek]: And I'm gonna move to the next, the next slide, and just kind of pause that there for a minute.

0:06:06.320,0:06:15.300
The ... I literally I'd never been to a captioned performance before with somebody doing it ...

0:06:15.300,0:06:16.580
sorry, not a caption performance.

0:06:16.580,0:06:21.960
Well, I hadn't been to a caption performance and I haven't been to a signed performance before.

0:06:21.960,0:06:25.660
And I had no idea. I was like, how are they going to sign?

0:06:27.580,0:06:32.800
And I don't know how how much you noticed but the ASL interpreter

0:06:33.560,0:06:37.480
was actually not really interpreting any words at all

0:06:37.480,0:06:40.340
but she was interpreting a whole lot of other pieces about the performance.

0:06:40.880,0:06:47.300
One of the very first things that she did ... showing, I don't if you saw with her left hand,

0:06:47.300,0:06:51.620
she was showing how Henry was tapping his feet to the music.

0:06:51.960,0:06:55.280
And so she was kind of reflecting that in what she was showing.

0:06:55.280,0:06:57.280
And she gets to the point where ...

0:06:58.580,0:07:02.400
a bit of that clip she's actually almost in time with him and when

0:07:02.880,0:07:06.160
you can hear his fingers going up and down the keyboard of the piano,

0:07:06.780,0:07:08.780
she's doing the same thing in the air.

0:07:09.020,0:07:13.060
And that ... and I'm getting goosebumps just talking about it because,

0:07:13.060,0:07:20.580
living that experience was ... to see because it really opened my mind to things I hadn't ever considered before.

0:07:21.020,0:07:25.920
I was like, why do we need captioning for an instrumental piece?

0:07:26.740,0:07:31.420
Why do we need interpretation for it? And it became an integral part of the performance.

0:07:31.800,0:07:35.700
And now, and so of course there was live captioning on the board up there.

0:07:35.700,0:07:38.800
I think it's about a three line captioning sign.

0:07:39.300,0:07:42.500
And now, we're gonna turn to ... this is one of my favorite parts.

0:07:42.740,0:07:47.980
Celia Hughes is an incredible audio describer, [clears throat] excuse me,

0:07:49.260,0:07:54.820
and this is what she does for a living and I'm just going to let you have a listen to

0:07:56.580,0:08:01.300
the way that she describes this. It's really quite fantastic.

0:08:02.000,0:08:07.100
[Video]: [Applause]

0:08:09.320,0:08:20.100
[Video]: [Woman speaking, describing what Harold is wearing]

0:08:20.760,0:08:27.520
[Video]: [Woman describing what Harold is wearing (cont.)]

0:08:29.540,0:09:00.200
[Video]: [Woman describing what Harold is wearing (cont.)]

0:09:01.820,0:09:24.760
[Video]: [Woman describing what another woman is wearing]

0:09:26.560,0:09:34.580
[Video]: Applause

0:09:35.620,0:09:38.000
[Video]: Harold introducing the next song he is about to play.

0:09:39.160,0:09:43.360
[Derek]: Now, I know it got a little bit meta there because we were actually having

0:09:43.780,0:09:52.340
an audio description and a person doing ASL interpretation of the audio description of the first ASL interpreter.

0:09:52.760,0:10:01.340
So it kind of got a little bit weird there for a minute, but she painted that picture incredibly well,

0:10:01.340,0:10:06.760
even to the point of explaining what that noise might be that people might be hearing from overhead.

0:10:07.700,0:10:13.640
The huge room is cooled by whirling ceiling fans or I can't remember exactly her phrasing.

0:10:14.540,0:10:22.840
That audio description was just as much a piece of performance art as the person playing the piano was creating.

0:10:23.780,0:10:25.180
It was integral to everything

0:10:25.560,0:10:32.380
Now just when you think ... incredibly inclusive event, it gets even better.

0:10:34.820,0:10:41.460
You see here the part where Celia was talking about the two large boards of plywood with the six sheets of white paper,

0:10:41.760,0:10:47.860
and they talked about paint and Carroll with the two pigtails and the bandanna I think in her hair.

0:10:50.120,0:10:53.800
Here's what happens next and actually throughout almost the entire performance,

0:10:54.600,0:11:01.760
Carol paints at the exact same time as the musical performance is happening.

0:11:01.760,0:11:03.760
So I have a few clips of that for you as well.

0:11:03.760,0:11:14.820
[Video]: Music

0:11:14.820,0:11:19.260
[Derek]: So this is at kinda of the beginning. She's kind of laying the background.

0:11:20.160,0:11:24.020
She's painting slowly as he's playing slowly.

0:11:25.220,0:11:30.700
And if we move to the next level or kind of later in the performance,

0:11:31.600,0:11:37.600
this is kind of that that side view and you can see she's looking over her shoulder at Henry to figure out what he's doing.

0:11:37.920,0:11:52.720
[Video]: [Music]

0:11:55.020,0:11:58.120
[Derek]: When we get to the point where she's actually finishing up the painting

0:11:58.340,0:12:03.640
and you can see here this is kind of the last song, and you can see that she is painting,

0:12:03.640,0:12:08.580
you can see that she's done kind of an abstraction of that piano in blue.

0:12:08.980,0:12:13.500
She's got Henry there, you can actually see right from the beginning where they talked about

0:12:13.920,0:12:16.200
how Henry's foot was tapping in time for the music.

0:12:16.200,0:12:19.660
I think Celia even said his his foot pounded the floor ...

0:12:20.800,0:12:24.700
... painting and you can see that she's actually reflected that in the painting itself,

0:12:24.700,0:12:28.100
by showing like multiple legs to convey that motion.

0:12:29.620,0:12:39.180
Absolutely every aspect of this is crafted and created and they play and

0:12:39.740,0:12:43.980
when Henry hits his last note she finishes the painting.

0:12:43.980,0:13:45.060
[Video]: [Music]

0:13:45.060,0:13:58.780
[Video]: [Applause]

0:13:59.940,0:14:06.660
[Derek]: And, the painting is finished and they take that painting and they auction it off for his charity.

0:14:09.700,0:14:15.960
Add to all of that, the fact that Henry has been blind almost his entire life

0:14:16.960,0:14:22.640
and this is what I think of when I think of inclusion and what that means.

0:14:23.440,0:14:32.160
This entire experience was handcrafted methodically thought-out and intentionally created

0:14:32.160,0:14:33.720
to be an inclusive experience.

0:14:35.880,0:14:39.600
This is what I want on us to do in digital spaces.

0:14:40.300,0:14:45.120
Building things for the web, when we're building a mobile app, when we're building creating a kiosk.

0:14:45.560,0:14:49.680
I mean, I don't want us to paint pictures of the kiosk,

0:14:49.880,0:14:54.440
I want us to actually make sure that the experiences that we are creating are as well thought-out as this.

0:14:55.780,0:15:03.880
This is, to me, what inclusion is about and I love this as an example of something for us to kind of strive towards in our work.

0:15:05.400,0:15:10.080
All the time that you know we talk about accessibility and we talk of being inclusive,

0:15:10.460,0:15:15.400
but we have some kind of limits on what that is because of decisions that other people have made.

0:15:15.760,0:15:19.720
Somebody has decided that this is what accessibility means and this is what inclusion means.

0:15:20.280,0:15:27.440
I want us to kind of expand that that mindset a little bit and make sure that we are actually thinking about these kinds of things.

0:15:28.960,0:15:34.440
If you think of design as a process through which we're kind of creating things and refining

0:15:34.440,0:15:36.900
and then ultimately expressing our intent,

0:15:37.300,0:15:43.900
that gives us a really kind of far-reaching mandate in terms of creating a great design.

0:15:44.340,0:15:54.200
... house in the UK and it's actually a house that's like community housing.

0:15:54.200,0:15:58.520
It's subsidized housing for people that are in a lower income bracket.

0:15:58.960,0:16:04.700
And you can see here there's ... it's a house, it's a duplex and they've got this you know front yard

0:16:04.700,0:16:09.000
that is, you know, I mean, it's not huge, but it's probably 100 feet long

0:16:09.000,0:16:14.080
and then, it's the width of the the entire house, and it's kind of these rolling hills

0:16:14.600,0:16:19.180
and you can see the steps on the left hand side, there's multiple levels of steps about six steps each.

0:16:19.540,0:16:23.940
And there's a woman that lives there with her child who happens to be in a wheelchair.

0:16:24.700,0:16:32.940
And they ... because it was community housing and they needed to make sure that it was an accessible entrance,

0:16:33.240,0:16:35.800
they actually said, well we need to do something about this.

0:16:35.800,0:16:39.240
And so they looked to make it an accessible entrance.

0:16:39.700,0:16:43.420
And so what they did was created a ramp ...

0:16:45.140,0:16:48.260
essentially fills up the entire front yard.

0:16:48.900,0:17:00.380
It's gray, not the most beautiful steel in the world, and it literally takes up the entire yard.

0:17:00.380,0:17:04.880
The grass has all been replaced with, I don't know if you can see it, but there's gravel everywhere.

0:17:05.060,0:17:12.240
And the ramp probably makes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, maybe eight switchback turns.

0:17:12.640,0:17:17.800
Now this ramp meets all the requirements for accessibility.

0:17:18.840,0:17:23.580
It's the right slope, it's got the right turning radius and the right amount of room to get around a corner

0:17:23.580,0:17:25.820
if you're in a scooter or in a wheelchair.

0:17:26.840,0:17:32.540
But it certainly doesn't do anything in terms of maintaining and preserving that back yard.

0:17:33.120,0:17:35.560
This is kind of ... I mean ...

0:17:36.100,0:17:39.560
here's other another view of it from the side.

0:17:39.820,0:17:45.060
And the state local skateboarding ... loves it. They think it's fantastic.

0:17:45.720,0:17:49.500
This is kind of and this is a view from the house, kind of looking down at the street,

0:17:49.500,0:17:52.800
where they've literally lost their entire yard.

0:17:54.340,0:18:00.440
There's a lot more to the story, but this is kind of like ... this is accessibility as an afterthought, right?

0:18:00.660,0:18:07.920
They didn't really have a choice, because the only way that they could do it was to build this monstrous ramp.

0:18:07.920,0:18:15.900
Now, it got the job done, but it was kind of like it was the only requirement instead of one of the requirements.

0:18:16.260,0:18:18.640
If they had actually had a requirement, that,

0:18:18.880,0:18:23.020
we need a mechanism to get somebody in the front door accessibly,

0:18:23.780,0:18:26.580
but also maintain the front yard,

0:18:27.120,0:18:29.140
they might have come up with very different solutions.

0:18:29.140,0:18:31.960
They might have created some kind of a lift system or, you know,

0:18:31.960,0:18:35.420
there might have been many other ways to solve this problem.

0:18:35.760,0:18:43.860
It's kind of like, it's accessibility by the book and its accessibility as the only requirement.

0:18:43.860,0:18:46.220
It's accessibility at the expense of everything else.

0:18:47.040,0:18:49.040
Now that access is really important.

0:18:49.640,0:18:57.740
The interesting thing was, the project cost about forty thousand dollars roughly forty thousand dollars US.

0:18:57.740,0:19:02.480
It was in Britain, so it was something like you know, twenty five thousand pounds or something like that.

0:19:04.700,0:19:08.040
I think they did some analysis and they actually found out later on that if they had

0:19:08.780,0:19:11.800
packed up their entire house, paid to pack up the entire house,

0:19:12.020,0:19:19.460
move them to another location, in the community housing and one of the newer, more recently built houses

0:19:19.700,0:19:22.440
that was accessible, where the entrance was at ground street level,

0:19:22.800,0:19:24.960
it would have probably cost them twenty thousand dollars.

0:19:25.720,0:19:27.660
And I think they realized that like way too late.

0:19:27.660,0:19:32.400
They were already in so far that they kind of missed that opportunity.

0:19:32.820,0:19:40.300
But when we look at accessibility this way, as a by-the-book thing, as a ... anything else,

0:19:40.680,0:19:47.360
yes, we still get access, but we don't have something that is actually an inclusive,

0:19:47.360,0:19:53.320
necessarily an inclusive process or an inclusive best outcome.

0:19:53.980,0:19:57.640
So I want you to kind of be thinking about those types of things as well.

0:19:57.900,0:20:04.000
This is a sign at the CNIB in Toronto and they built a new facility several years ago.

0:20:04.000,0:20:05.420
We went on a tour.

0:20:05.600,0:20:09.900
And this is the sign for ... just outside their deafblind literacy lab.

0:20:10.360,0:20:15.760
And there's a whole bunch of things that are really accessible, really obviously accessible about this.

0:20:15.760,0:20:21.520
One of them is the big, the very large white lettering that's on a dark background.

0:20:22.820,0:20:27.700
Interestingly enough, those letters and, it's  tough to see here, but those letters are recessed,

0:20:28.200,0:20:33.360
so that somebody can trace those letters with their finger, and read them that way.

0:20:33.360,0:20:38.280
So if they were just kind of like sublimated and pressed onto the sign,

0:20:39.480,0:20:41.040
... have the opportunity to do that.

0:20:41.040,0:20:46.000
So a nice large high contrast lettering, it's recessed, and then you can see down here,

0:20:46.000,0:20:53.460
below the main part of the sign, there's this extra part or this part where they've got Braille.

0:20:53.460,0:20:57.960
And they've got, instead of recessed lettering, they've got raised all-caps lettering,

0:20:57.960,0:21:03.620
so that somebody could trace those letter forms as well to figure out what room it is.

0:21:03.960,0:21:08.380
But my favorite part is that where the Braille is and the raised lettering,

0:21:09.440,0:21:17.260
that piece is on a kind of a piece that protrudes out from the sign at about a 45 degree angle.

0:21:17.600,0:21:20.360
And I asked them why, so this is really fascinating, tell me more about that.

0:21:20.360,0:21:21.780
They said it's really straightforward.

0:21:22.000,0:21:28.840
We noticed in our old building that people would walk along the hallway a feeling for a sign.

0:21:28.840,0:21:31.300
They would have their hand on the wall, and they would be feeling for the sign.

0:21:31.300,0:21:37.700
And when they felt the sign, we saw that they were like dropping their shoulder and had to turn their hand

0:21:37.700,0:21:41.980
so that they could get a flat ... those raised characters in the Braille.

0:21:42.400,0:21:48.360
They said, so we just put it on an angle and it means that when as people walk along, it's just a natural reading angle.

0:21:48.860,0:21:50.160
That's like, brilliant!

0:21:50.520,0:21:55.640
That's kind of the thing that I want us to do on the web, right?

0:21:55.640,0:21:58.340
We thought about making this easy to use.

0:21:58.680,0:22:04.500
We talk a lot in UX as we want to create delightful and seductive experiences.

0:22:04.500,0:22:11.180
We talked about creating engagement for someone with with a disability.

0:22:11.180,0:22:18.140
It might actually be really wonderful to have that as well and not just a thing that passes the minimum level of compliance.

0:22:19.380,0:22:24.040
That's kind of the way that I'd love for us in this, and I don't mean us,

0:22:24.040,0:22:28.660
I mean like us to take that to the companies that we work for and advocate for that.

0:22:29.240,0:22:33.320
Because I think all of you in this room are probably already thinking along those lines,

0:22:33.580,0:22:36.920
or would be very ... it's like a very short jump for you to do that.

0:22:37.900,0:22:41.860
But we report to, that make decisions, those are the ones that we need to kind of

0:22:42.560,0:22:46.320
think about convincing them that this is the way that we want to go.

0:22:47.840,0:22:55.700
So there's two sides, when I spend a lot of time thinking about and working on inclusive design

0:22:55.700,0:22:56.820
and there's two sides to it.

0:22:56.820,0:23:01.780
There's an inclusive design, which means we've created the design that is inclusive.

0:23:01.780,0:23:03.980
That's an outcome, right?

0:23:03.980,0:23:11.760
Access or accessibility is an outcome, and I really like to think about inclusive design, the process, right?

0:23:11.760,0:23:19.000
Inclusive design, too often, ends up being a thing about we're going to create an inclusive design in terms of the outcome.

0:23:19.000,0:23:25.500
And then, it focuses on code and not the design aspects itself. So let's think about that.

0:23:25.500,0:23:32.620
I want you to think about that duality that design is actually a it can be a noun or it can be a verb, right,

0:23:32.620,0:23:36.700
and in that way we're really thinking of inclusive as the adjective.

0:23:37.120,0:23:42.040
So accessibility might be the ability to be accessed or readily used by people with disabilities.

0:23:45.220,0:23:48.780
There's a definition of inclusive design.

0:23:49.660,0:23:52.300
It's handy. It comes from a British standard.

0:23:52.580,0:23:56.440
The thing that I love about it the most the design of mainstream products and/or services

0:23:56.440,0:24:00.620
that are accessible to and usable by as many people as reasonably possible

0:24:00.620,0:24:03.820
without the need for special adaptation or specialized design.

0:24:04.260,0:24:09.940
It's a very, I mean, it's a useful definition but it's very much a book academic type definition.

0:24:10.220,0:24:14.800
My favorite part of it is the focus on products and/or services.

0:24:15.180,0:24:20.980
We're often thinking about product in the work that we do and we don't necessarily think about service.

0:24:21.540,0:24:27.640
There's actually a huge kind of, I don't wanna say movement, but there's there's a  large group of people

0:24:27.640,0:24:29.640
that are working on service design now.

0:24:30.140,0:24:35.540
And so, my take on a lot of that is ... service design actually mean.

0:24:36.000,0:24:38.840
And so, let's look at that with a little bit more of this framework.

0:24:38.840,0:24:44.420
I look at inclusive UX design as intentional facilitation and a crafting

0:24:44.420,0:24:50.320
of interactions, touch points, and processes within a product or services ecosystem,

0:24:50.840,0:24:53.500
Where inclusion is actually a core value.

0:24:54.500,0:24:57.740
And that to me is the difference about what we're talking about here.

0:24:57.740,0:25:05.280
These last ... five words, inclusion as a core value, to me makes all the difference.

0:25:06.000,0:25:09.600
When we incorporate it as a core value into the things that we do,

0:25:09.600,0:25:17.100
and we're constantly looking at that as a kind of a check point as a thing to keep us

0:25:17.620,0:25:22.040
grounded in our goal is inclusion as a core value does this live up to that?

0:25:22.480,0:25:25.780
If we look at that throughout the entire process of what we do,

0:25:26.300,0:25:29.500
then that changes how we approach things in a few ways.

0:25:30.780,0:25:35.980
Another example and then we'll kind of, I can't even tell how long I've been going so I'm just going to keep talking.

0:25:36.300,0:25:44.760
This is one that I learned about. It's at the Vancouver Airport in Canada.

0:25:45.720,0:25:53.200
And, because Canada, they've created this program called "You can do it,"

0:25:54.980,0:26:02.540
and it is, people that are new travelers, but particularly for children with autism.

0:26:02.940,0:26:07.360
But not just children, but even adults with autism that are taking their first journey on a plane.

0:26:07.880,0:26:14.280
And they know that one of the things that people that are somewhere on the autistic spectrum,

0:26:14.560,0:26:17.140
in many ways crave is kind of that,

0:26:17.600,0:26:20.940
and this is not something that you can say about every person with autism, but

0:26:21.220,0:26:28.600
there's a predictability to what's going to happen that is very useful for helping people with autism

0:26:29.080,0:26:31.480
work through new experiences.

0:26:31.480,0:26:36.100
So knowing, you know, having that predictability and knowing what they're about to experience

0:26:36.420,0:26:41.100
can make that less of an anxiety ridden experience, right?

0:26:41.840,0:26:46.380
So there's probably always going to be some anxiety, but they've actually gone to the point of creating things

0:26:46.860,0:26:50.200
so that they help reduce that anxiety.

0:26:50.620,0:26:58.100
And I find this fascinating, they actually created a series of printable checklist as part of a book.

0:26:58.100,0:27:04.180
So they were printable on their own, but they're actually there's like almost like a coloring book type thing

0:27:04.180,0:27:13.120
that you would give to, you provide to people to say here's what that journey is about to be like.

0:27:13.440,0:27:15.340
And so on this one, going to the gate.

0:27:15.800,0:27:18.520
So this is, and it's always in the form, I love this form.

0:27:18.520,0:27:25.720
Because it's a series of four check boxes ... statement about what you need to do in really simple terms,

0:27:25.920,0:27:34.320
and then there's like an illustrated pictograph-type image that is beside it

0:27:34.320,0:27:38.260
to kind of remind you about what that's about, to kind of anchor that experience.

0:27:38.260,0:27:44.500
So the first one is check box check your gate number and there's a little picture of of their boarding pass

0:27:44.500,0:27:47.340
to kind of show them that that's the thing they need to check their gate number on.

0:27:47.720,0:27:54.640
If you need help, ask for information and there's a picture of the the big circle with the eye in it,

0:27:54.640,0:27:59.680
and somebody that's actually talking to that eye to kind of signifying ask for information.

0:27:59.980,0:28:03.020
Walk to the gate, the picture of a person walking,

0:28:03.020,0:28:08.020
And then, I love this, all done, picture of a happy face, right?

0:28:08.340,0:28:13.180
And if you look at the next one on the journey, here's what happens at the gate.

0:28:14.120,0:28:17.780
I won't go through them all, but wait for your turn to board, choose an activity while you wait,

0:28:17.960,0:28:21.720
listen for your turn to board, and then again, all done.

0:28:22.880,0:28:24.580
The next one, take off.

0:28:24.960,0:28:30.040
Listen to announcements, put your tray table up, put away your phone, tablet, laptop,

0:28:30.280,0:28:32.780
seat is up, nice and straight, all done.

0:28:34.840,0:28:36.960
You see where that predictability is coming into it?

0:28:36.960,0:28:40.240
I love the fact that it's the same thing every time

0:28:40.420,0:28:44.880
and there's actually a thing that says you're done when you've checked off this thing.

0:28:45.600,0:28:50.900
So, it's an explicit done, not just, you got them all done.

0:28:50.900,0:28:54.640
There's no more to check off, it's like there's actually a certain satisfaction

0:28:54.880,0:28:58.860
and they're creating that expectation that this is actually a good step to be in.

0:28:58.860,0:29:03.380
This is where we show the happy face and we're reducing anxiety.

0:29:03.920,0:29:08.940
I love this. Airplane ride, choose an activity, ask before going to the toilet,

0:29:09.580,0:29:12.640
the bathroom is very small and makes it very loud flush noise.

0:29:13.040,0:29:15.340
Helping people to predict the unpredictable.

0:29:16.560,0:29:19.420
You can cover your ears if you want, all done.

0:29:20.240,0:29:27.760
This, to me, is an incredible display of understanding what people with autism

0:29:27.760,0:29:32.400
are actually maybe going to go through on their particular journey, literally

0:29:32.400,0:29:35.160
not just like their customer journey but on their journey.

0:29:37.920,0:29:40.640
They didn't need to do this, this is not part of any law.

0:29:42.980,0:29:46.120
They just did it and it's the airport that did it.

0:29:46.900,0:29:49.400
I have lots of friends that work at airlines.

0:29:51.000,0:29:57.900
The Air Carrier Access Act in any way shape or form, this is not one airline that's saying we're gonna do this.

0:29:58.100,0:30:04.240
This is the airport saying we're gonna do this, because it helps ...

0:30:04.240,0:30:08.020
and we're seeing a lot more and more of this type of thing happening,

0:30:08.240,0:30:15.940
where there's early boarding for a ... certain airlines will do this, where they have noise free boarding.

0:30:16.700,0:30:23.520
And they will actually have the opportunity, if you have some form of autism or some other, you know,

0:30:23.520,0:30:29.000
some other particular need, like, it's like we do that pre-boarding like you know people with disabilities

0:30:29.000,0:30:32.180
and children under two ages, you and your families can go on first.

0:30:32.180,0:30:33.320
They've actually set this up.

0:30:34.180,0:30:39.940
Prior to that, they set it up and say we're gonna now have a silent boarding for five minutes,

0:30:39.940,0:30:44.700
so that you can go in and get settled in your chair, in your seat with nothing else happening ...

0:30:46.120,0:30:47.520
... nothing else happening.

0:30:48.040,0:30:53.600
Stores, retail stores are instituting hours of quiet shopping,

0:30:54.380,0:31:00.820
where the music isn't playing, where there's no announcements, where it's just kind of silent shopping.

0:31:01.140,0:31:05.420
And they know that everybody is you know gonna minimize their talking.

0:31:05.760,0:31:07.840
You know, I think a lot of us would like that, exactly.

0:31:07.980,0:31:13.140
So there's a lot more of this that's happening and you should be expecting to see more people

0:31:13.140,0:31:18.680
and more organizations kind of taking that kind of thing on and embracing it and and being part of it.

0:31:19.740,0:31:24.440
I had talked really, really briefly about web accessibility and the Air Carrier Access Act,

0:31:24.440,0:31:30.200
because we're in Chicago, done a lot of work with airlines over the last three years

0:31:30.200,0:31:32.400
in terms of their accessibility initiatives.

0:31:33.220,0:31:40.060
One of the things that the Air Carrier Access Act does is it says, not only do you need to make sure that you meet

0:31:40.060,0:31:47.820
the technical standard, you also have to meet some kind of usability and performance standards.

0:31:47.820,0:31:52.980
And they've got this wording in there that says, the ACAA requires carriers to test the usability

0:31:52.980,0:31:57.780
of they're accessible primary web sites in consultation with individuals or organizations

0:31:58.100,0:32:01.120
representing visual, auditory, tactile and cognitive disabilities.

0:32:01.580,0:32:03.860
It's brilliant. This is actually in the legislation.

0:32:04.480,0:32:07.740
It's not enough to build to that standard anymore,

0:32:08.340,0:32:14.360
they're actually, publicly recognizing, you need to really test this, with real people.

0:32:15.640,0:32:23.080
Not people that work for your airline, because people that work for your airline they know too much.

0:32:24.880,0:32:29.680
Way, way too much. They know exactly how it's supposed to work, right?

0:32:30.580,0:32:34.600
So, and I love this, and there's a lot of really good lessons and things that we learned

0:32:34.600,0:32:39.560
from working with Airlines, like there are some really good things, like they basically said right away,

0:32:39.560,0:32:41.560
let's do this with real people, this is good.

0:32:41.900,0:32:46.980
Like, that was my, this is my favorite piece of legislation related to accessibility, ever,

0:32:46.980,0:32:48.320
at least for now.

0:32:48.440,0:32:51.760
Because they built this requirement in, like you have to do this.

0:32:52.080,0:32:58.820
The only negative that we saw with it was that there were people like to take words

0:33:00.360,0:33:04.480
and talk about those words a lot and say things like

0:33:07.320,0:33:11.460
it doesn't say with those results, we just have to test in consultation with them.

0:33:11.820,0:33:17.560
And when we say in consultation with them, does that mean we can test and just kind of talk to them about it?

0:33:17.860,0:33:22.040
Like real conversations, alright, real conversations.

0:33:22.380,0:33:26.200
So when we get into wording and accessibility people, for whatever reason,

0:33:26.200,0:33:29.620
we really like to dive deep into the meaning of words, to find like

0:33:31.140,0:33:34.000
what do they mean by that and what does that mean that I actually have to do,

0:33:34.000,0:33:40.660
and sometimes, not you, sometimes other people will be like, because of the way this is worded,

0:33:40.980,0:33:43.140
I think we can get out of doing it, right?

0:33:43.140,0:33:46.760
Like completely missing the point of doing it in the first place.

0:33:48.220,0:33:50.860
So those words can be used and twisted.

0:33:52.420,0:33:58.120
Then when they worked on the ACAA, they said we have several seven core travel functions.

0:33:58.820,0:34:03.980
Make and change a reservation, check-in, your actual itinerary, flight status, frequent flyer account,

0:34:04.400,0:34:06.880
flight schedules, and carrier contact information.

0:34:07.340,0:34:12.000
The thing that I love about this and saying what they did about the seven core travel functions

0:34:12.340,0:34:20.300
and they kind of rolled it out differently, they said, in the first year you need to do the seven core travel functions.

0:34:20.300,0:34:26.400
And then, in the second year, you need to do the rest of the site and make it accessible.

0:34:27.140,0:34:30.420
Smart ... really smart. Why?

0:34:30.920,0:34:32.140
They prioritize it.

0:34:33.140,0:34:38.220
Now, they change the dates on things. They've made December 2015 into June 2016.

0:34:38.220,0:34:43.480
They left December 2016 as it was, but one of the cool and we don't know what's gonna happen next,

0:34:43.480,0:34:45.480
nobody knows what's gonna happen next.

0:34:45.480,0:34:52.500
But, the huge lesson, it was awesome because they kind of pre-prioritized it and said

0:34:52.500,0:34:55.000
let's focus on these things, right?

0:34:55.960,0:35:01.280
When we were working with airlines, we said okay, frequent flyer, yes that's important,

0:35:01.680,0:35:07.500
but ... and flight status is important, itinerary is important, and check-in is important,

0:35:08.200,0:35:14.500
but if you can't book a flight in the first place, none of that other stuff matters, right?

0:35:15.020,0:35:19.340
So they kind of did some prioritization on this, and said these are the seven most important things,

0:35:19.560,0:35:23.800
and even in the way that they listed them, they kind of went along that customer journey,

0:35:25.020,0:35:29.860
and helped you make some sense of that, so that you could actually prioritize.

0:35:29.860,0:35:32.940
So, really, really good from a prioritization perspective.

0:35:34.260,0:35:38.700
Interesting thing though, the whole thing was kind of pre-siloed, we hate silos, right?

0:35:39.380,0:35:44.680
I mean, I assume, maybe not everybody hates silos, but people tend to hate ...tend to hate silos.

0:35:44.840,0:35:48.120
And here's one of the things that the Department of Transportation built in.

0:35:49.160,0:35:55.940
Their stance on mobile was kind of like this and I say this because

0:35:56.280,0:36:03.060
all of this legislation happened, and get ready for some sound here, because why would I not do this,

0:36:05.240,0:36:06.840
... on the Air Carrier Access Act.

0:36:06.840,0:36:10.700
This Act has been in place for decades, right?

0:36:10.740,0:36:15.300
It's only just recently that they made these amendments to include the web and digital things.

0:36:15.660,0:36:20.820
So they were working on it kind of ... a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.

0:36:29.300,0:36:30.400
We'll move on from it though ...

0:36:30.400,0:36:34.660
They were building this or creating this in 2011, 2012 type era.

0:36:35.880,0:36:38.900
...  it's going to be in 2015, 2016.

0:36:38.900,0:36:45.340
So when they were working on it in 2011 and 2012, the state of things was much different, right?

0:36:45.760,0:36:51.680
So mobile websites, mobile apps and other electronic communications technology, they actually said,

0:36:51.900,0:36:55.940
we believe that certain factors, however, preclude introducing new accessibility requirements

0:36:55.940,0:37:00.800
for electronic information communication technologies other than websites at this time.

0:37:03.040,0:37:04.840
You just make your websites accessible.

0:37:05.420,0:37:07.420
Don't worry about your mobile app.

0:37:07.960,0:37:12.740
You know, the thing that now 90% of people probably go to first.

0:37:13.480,0:37:21.620
They basically created a silo by the way that they created this legislation, and with their stuff.

0:37:21.980,0:37:26.480
They said this no accessibility standards specifically exist for mobile websites at this time.

0:37:28.800,0:37:33.000
Like we're good there now. Like there's some really good accessibility standards.

0:37:33.220,0:37:36.860
It's called WCAG and it applies to mobile websites. Period.

0:37:38.280,0:37:41.720
We do responsive design now that kind of takes care of a lot of this stuff.

0:37:41.940,0:37:45.700
Accessibility standards such as WCAG2 cannot be readily applied to mobile apps

0:37:45.700,0:37:47.960
designed for mobile platforms that are not accessible.

0:37:48.640,0:37:50.780
Well guess what? The platform's are now accessible.

0:37:51.640,0:37:54.960
They're not perfect, but they are way more accessible than they were.

0:37:55.260,0:38:00.220
Most mobile devices currently on the market are not accessible to individuals who are blind or visually impaired ...

0:38:00.220,0:38:05.500
... who and the need to focus carrier attention on reason and resources on bringing existing websites

0:38:05.500,0:38:07.500
into compliance with WCAG 2 Double A.

0:38:11.480,0:38:15.600
They basically created their own silos, right?

0:38:15.900,0:38:17.800
So they did say this.

0:38:18.480,0:38:21.740
We, and I'll pull out ... this is a big thing, I'm gonna let it go.

0:38:21.900,0:38:26.940
But they've basically said, we encourage everybody to also do accessibility features

0:38:26.940,0:38:30.320
when they're doing email and text messaging and other electronic things.

0:38:31.520,0:38:37.700
But, you know, you kind of don't have to we think it's gonna make your life easier down the road but you don't have to.

0:38:38.420,0:38:41.640
... the future and less costly, but you don't have to.

0:38:41.640,0:38:46.720
So how many people do you think actually said like yeah well let's go all-in on it

0:38:46.840,0:38:51.000
and spend that time now, 'cause ... you know that they didn't.

0:38:51.000,0:38:53.580
Some organizations did in certain ways.

0:38:54.100,0:38:59.240
Some people were already building things to be responsive and use responsive web design and so it worked.

0:39:00.080,0:39:01.780
They already had some of that.

0:39:02.580,0:39:07.820
So they're giving an important lesson, like, "hey go ahead and be proactive about this because it's not there yet."

0:39:08.560,0:39:15.700
But ... also said this is not important right now put everything you have into your website.

0:39:16.380,0:39:19.580
Like what's your website now and even like how do you even define it?

0:39:20.200,0:39:27.060
They're really had that old ... the website is the thing that you go to on your desktop computer or your laptop

0:39:27.060,0:39:31.780
and they didn't even really ... yeah you know, I don't know what was in their heads.

0:39:32.000,0:39:34.960
I'm not Kreskin, I don't know. I just don't know.

0:39:35.740,0:39:38.480
So, they kind of pre-siloed things, right.

0:39:38.700,0:39:41.540
And when we think of products, when we build things,

0:39:41.840,0:39:46.980
we often think of products and channels as these siloed things.

0:39:47.120,0:39:53.700
So we have web, we have the app, we have email channels, it's fine.

0:39:53.700,0:39:57.640
Only this one, the rest of them are all good, well that one is.

0:40:00.980,0:40:02.980
We'll get it back.

0:40:04.640,0:40:07.540
If this screen was on, you would see five silos.

0:40:08.200,0:40:12.440
One of them says web, one of them says app, one of them says email, one of them says ticketing,

0:40:12.440,0:40:17.380
and one of them says something that I can't read from here and I also forget what it says.

0:40:17.780,0:40:20.160
What does it say ... helpdesk.

0:40:21.000,0:40:26.000
Each one of those things, when we think of them as products or as channels,

0:40:26.180,0:40:31.080
they are necessarily siloed, right, because that's the way that we think about it.

0:40:31.600,0:40:33.640
Oh, yes, thank you.

0:40:35.460,0:40:42.080
So the trouble with some of that silo-ism, I don't even think that's a thing, but, I made up that word,

0:40:42.080,0:40:48.640
that silo-ism, there's no shared learnings between people that are working on the app and say on the web.

0:40:49.080,0:40:54.360
Now they have really, really important lessons to teach one another and they're going through the same pains,

0:40:54.540,0:40:58.700
and yet they don't have the opportunity, because of the way organizations are often set up.

0:40:59.260,0:41:04.180
The other thing that was actually a tough lesson to learn is that they ended up spending more time

0:41:04.180,0:41:08.060
and more effort on it, because they were siloed.

0:41:08.740,0:41:13.520
So when we think of things from a service perspective, we want to kind of think of them

0:41:13.520,0:41:14.980
at a more holistic level.

0:41:15.220,0:41:21.400
You don't see these things until you are actually working on real projects.

0:41:21.400,0:41:28.040
We do ... one of the things that we do, because many of our clients require it is we do background checks.

0:41:28.200,0:41:32.900
This is Rhea, who's on our team, and Rhea is a young woman in the Philippines.

0:41:34.020,0:41:36.240
She is blind and uses a screen reader,

0:41:36.240,0:41:41.800
and so we do background checks. We have to, it's just like, that's what we have to do.

0:41:41.800,0:41:46.600
And so I said to her, "I don't know what this process is like."

0:41:46.900,0:41:50.040
"Are you willing to kind of, experiment on it with us?"

0:41:50.040,0:41:55.020
And I actually talked with the vendor about it and said you know is this accessible to people with  disabilities?

0:41:55.020,0:42:00.000
And they're like, I don't know, let me talk to the team and they got back and they said well ...

0:42:01.920,0:42:09.060
... it's mostly accessible to people with disabilities, particularly if you have somebody that's blind.

0:42:09.060,0:42:14.300
If somebody sits there with them and kind of tells them what's on the screen, you should be just fine.

0:42:14.300,0:42:15.780
I like ... what?

0:42:15.780,0:42:23.900
So Rhea was was doing her background check for us and goes through this form and everything seems okay.

0:42:23.900,0:42:28.540
And I asked her like, how was it, you know, just so you know everything came back clean, it was all good.

0:42:30.080,0:42:32.300
But I said, you know, how was it?

0:42:32.760,0:42:38.580
And, keeping in mind that it's a background check, she said it was pretty accessible, except for two things.

0:42:38.980,0:42:40.800
I'm like, okay cool, let's figure out what this is.

0:42:40.800,0:42:44.800
She said, first thing, I really I had to get my brother to help me with my birthday.

0:42:45.040,0:42:46.740
Like adding my birth date into it.

0:42:47.280,0:42:52.760
And the second thing I really needed my brother's help was with doing my signature.

0:42:53.280,0:42:57.800
Like, those two things are actually pretty important for a background check.

0:42:58.560,0:43:05.080
Kind of like probably some of the most important things birthday and your actual authorization to go in

0:43:05.080,0:43:07.660
and figure out whether all this data is true or not.

0:43:07.960,0:43:10.060
Really, really kind of difficult.

0:43:10.940,0:43:16.160
If you seen, know this violinist, Itzhak Perlman?

0:43:17.520,0:43:21.140
So, a thing happened with with Air Canada.

0:43:21.140,0:43:29.140
They kind of left him there. They escorted him part of the way to his flight and then stopped.

0:43:30.260,0:43:35.400
And he was interviewed about it afterwards, and he said you know he helped me with one bag,

0:43:35.420,0:43:39.740
which he carried unwillingly, and then he said, ... you're gonna ...

0:43:40.860,0:43:42.860
[Laughter]

0:43:43.200,0:43:45.220
I don't have time for this.

0:43:48.300,0:43:50.300
My heart dropped when I read this interview.

0:43:51.280,0:43:52.640
Like wha ...

0:43:54.700,0:43:59.960
This dude ... is a world-class violinist,

0:44:00.860,0:44:03.200
is worth multiple millions of dollars,

0:44:05.140,0:44:11.180
and he needed help carrying it and his other bags and this is what happened to him.

0:44:12.300,0:44:17.340
Like ... I just ... I can't even ... like, wow.

0:44:18.080,0:44:24.740
These experiences, I wish they were like once in like a million.

0:44:25.980,0:44:28.760
We've seen, we've all seen what happens.

0:44:28.760,0:44:30.340
We've seen what happens, right?

0:44:30.960,0:44:36.540
Now this is not to say that it only happens in Airlines, this happens everywhere, right?

0:44:37.000,0:44:37.860
It happens.

0:44:39.980,0:44:43.040
I think in many ways is diversity by default.

0:44:43.540,0:44:47.200
And, I've only got a few more things here and then we'll just kind of talk for the rest of the time.

0:44:48.380,0:44:49.680
Diversity by default.

0:44:49.680,0:44:54.420
And one of my favorite phrases comes from,

0:44:54.420,0:44:58.100
there's actually two gentlemen that kind of said the same thing at almost the same time.

0:44:58.100,0:45:04.580
And one of them was this gentleman, Michaelmas Sousa, South African gentleman.

0:45:05.180,0:45:06.600
"Nothing about us, without us."

0:45:06.600,0:45:08.380
He had a disability himself and he said,

0:45:08.380,0:45:10.180
"nothing about us, without us."

0:45:10.180,0:45:14.540
He was one of the first people to say that, in kind of the early not early 90s.

0:45:14.960,0:45:20.520
We do so many things that we talk about as being beneficial for people with disabilities,

0:45:20.520,0:45:28.860
or that, you know, we're doing this for these or we're creating accessible things or we're creating inclusive experiences.

0:45:29.200,0:45:31.700
But we don't actually involve people with disabilities in it.

0:45:33.240,0:45:34.220
Very rare.

0:45:35.200,0:45:37.640
We like to think that we're doing much better than we are.

0:45:38.160,0:45:43.680
And I'm gonna ... I will put my hand up and say I know I can do better in this.

0:45:44.260,0:45:45.240
We all can.

0:45:48.100,0:45:53.140
I love this idea, nothing about us without us. And that that means a few things.

0:45:53.140,0:45:55.380
So can you meet these higher goals?

0:45:56.380,0:45:57.600
Independence.

0:45:58.320,0:46:04.720
Your use of a product or service should not require you to rely on any other individual, like our friend Rhea,

0:46:05.440,0:46:09.820
who relied on her brother for two critical pieces in that process.

0:46:10.620,0:46:11.680
Dignity.

0:46:12.460,0:46:16.280
Your use of a product or service should not require you to ask anyone else for help.

0:46:17.720,0:46:18.700
Period.

0:46:19.700,0:46:22.020
It may happen, but it should not require it.

0:46:23.940,0:46:29.680
You should have the dignity, or be able to maintain your dignity by being able to do this on your own.

0:46:31.560,0:46:36.560
My dad, we went to Disney in October of last year,

0:46:36.960,0:46:40.860
and he sent me a text message one morning that said, you know, he was having trouble ...

0:46:41.100,0:46:43.500
when you go to Disney, you get the Magic Band that goes on your wrist.

0:46:43.500,0:46:46.020
and they connect your tickets to it and your hotel room key,

0:46:46.020,0:46:53.260
it's all one thing and you just Magic Band everything and magic happens.

0:46:53.260,0:46:55.200
That's my guess why they call it the Magic Band.

0:46:56.060,0:47:00.980
But he was trying to get his tickets connected to his Magic Band and he couldn't do it.

0:47:01.600,0:47:06.400
He's trying and trying and trying to put in his reservation number the ticket number and it wouldn't connect it, wouldn't connect.

0:47:06.780,0:47:10.000
And I'm like, do you want me to help? He's like, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.

0:47:10.000,0:47:13.940
And my dad, he doesn't want to ask for help very much.

0:47:13.940,0:47:16.280
But he sent me a text message this morning.

0:47:16.280,0:47:19.480
He said okay I got it figured out. I went down to the front desk ...

0:47:20.480,0:47:23.260
and I got the person at the counter to help me.

0:47:23.540,0:47:29.400
He said, he couldn't do it either and he had to go into the main system to get the two things connected.

0:47:30.160,0:47:33.420
And he said, so now I no longer feel like an idiot.

0:47:34.660,0:47:46.320
I was like, he's my dad, you know, like, and he feels like insignificant as part of this.

0:47:46.320,0:47:51.720
So your use of a product or service should not induce feelings that you are at fault for the barriers that the service imposes.

0:47:51.880,0:47:56.560
He assumed that he was doing it wrong, because he was getting error messages on the screen.

0:47:58.040,0:48:02.680
So therefore, it was his fault ... nothing to do with you.

0:48:02.680,0:48:05.720
The main person at the desk couldn't even do it.

0:48:06.320,0:48:11.340
Choice. Your use of a product or service should not prevent you from making choices that other people have.

0:48:12.460,0:48:13.880
What I mean by that is,

0:48:14.320,0:48:17.060
we cannot set up systems where

0:48:19.500,0:48:26.620
your fallback position is that you call a help center from 8:00 a.m. Eastern until 8:00 p.m. Pacific.

0:48:29.680,0:48:36.180
I work the night shift. I get home from work at 4:00 a.m. and therefore that's when I have time to do my whatever it is.

0:48:37.260,0:48:39.860
And that call center or whatever it is, is not open.

0:48:40.240,0:48:42.700
You don't have that choice anymore because it's something they did.

0:48:44.640,0:48:47.720
Security and privacy. Your use of a product or service should not require you to

0:48:47.720,0:48:52.800
disclose sensitive personal information to a third party other than those you're disclosing the information to.

0:48:54.140,0:48:55.200
I think of Rhea.

0:48:55.820,0:48:58.980
I think of a friend of mine, Stacy, who was blind and using a screen reader.

0:48:59.240,0:49:03.320
And when he was trying to sign up for his online banking,

0:49:04.480,0:49:07.880
he needed to get somebody else to do it because when he

0:49:09.140,0:49:14.380
no word of a lie, when he was going through the process himself,

0:49:16.680,0:49:20.580
he was getting his screen reader to read out his bank card number so that he could activate it,

0:49:20.940,0:49:26.000
and the the customer service rep on the other end of the phone could hear his screen reader,

0:49:26.000,0:49:30.580
and thought that there was somebody else in the room there that was coercing him into doing that.

0:49:32.060,0:49:35.100
And, so he ended up actually, to get it to work,

0:49:35.100,0:49:39.780
he had to disclose his card number to somebody else and his personal details to somebody else

0:49:39.780,0:49:42.960
to get them to go through that because they didn't know how to deal with

0:49:43.940,0:49:46.040
a screen reader, reading on the other side of it.

0:49:46.200,0:49:52.060
Now, you probably could have put in headphones, but that also makes it difficult to manage two conversations.

0:49:52.060,0:49:54.460
One with his screen reader and one with the person on the other end.

0:49:55.520,0:49:58.400
But you should never have to disclose something sensitive to a third party,

0:49:58.400,0:50:01.420
just because a system happens to be inaccessible.

0:50:02.620,0:50:04.760
So these are kind of the higher goals that I want to think of

0:50:04.760,0:50:08.340
and we want to be thinking about enabling participation in process.

0:50:08.820,0:50:11.740
So I want you, as you're thinking about this, as you're moving forward

0:50:13.180,0:50:17.020
to do things like making sure that you're including people with disabilities in all of the work.

0:50:18.060,0:50:19.540
In the original design.

0:50:20.500,0:50:23.540
In talking about the original design, and doing the research

0:50:23.540,0:50:29.980
in doing all of the pieces that go there and even look at your processes and the tools that you use,

0:50:31.000,0:50:35.720
how many people in here, just you know raise your hand and say "I",

0:50:37.200,0:50:42.660
how many people in here know that they use a piece of software, whether it's a website, a web app,

0:50:42.660,0:50:45.220
or some software, that they know is not accessible?

0:50:46.200,0:50:47.420
Raise your hand and say "I".

0:50:48.440,0:50:52.000
You didn't say enough eyes. Cause I know there's more than that.

0:50:54.540,0:50:56.980
That was about sixty percent of the room.

0:50:57.460,0:51:00.280
Those tools that you're using that aren't accessible

0:51:02.360,0:51:08.380
prevent you from even hiring somebody with a disability to do that job or to participate in the process.

0:51:09.620,0:51:11.620
Whether you're hiring them for an hour to give you feedback

0:51:11.620,0:51:16.160
or you're hiring them as a permanent member of your team or you're hiring them for a six-month contract,

0:51:18.280,0:51:20.280
think not just about the tools but the process.

0:51:21.400,0:51:25.360
How many people do a daily stand-up as part of their as part of their work?

0:51:25.360,0:51:26.380
Hands up and say "I".

0:51:27.760,0:51:30.100
So about a third of you.

0:51:30.360,0:51:34.540
Does that daily stand up an in-person thing where you're gathered around a physical

0:51:35.100,0:51:37.100
scrum board  or a Kanban board?

0:51:38.960,0:51:41.880
Most of you are saying yes, some of you are saying no.

0:51:43.140,0:51:50.660
How easy is it for someone that is, for someone they can't see that physical board

0:51:51.960,0:51:53.960
to participate in that stand-up?

0:51:55.260,0:52:00.640
It's potentially much easier for them if they have a digital manifestation of that board,

0:52:01.220,0:52:05.820
with all of the ability to take something from one column and move it to another?

0:52:06.180,0:52:11.420
So not just the tools that you use, but the processes that you use, right?

0:52:11.420,0:52:16.760
What's your ... how many of you do all these things ... by meetings?

0:52:16.760,0:52:19.760
We've ... we actually looked at our own process and said,

0:52:20.360,0:52:23.220
because we had a potential client that came to us

0:52:23.660,0:52:29.780
and they had a ... the lead for their accessibility initiatives was deaf.

0:52:31.360,0:52:34.340
And we had to question everything from the very beginning

0:52:34.340,0:52:36.920
and it was great, because that person actually said to us,

0:52:37.240,0:52:43.100
you know, hey, when we're talking, you know email or some other text communication form is best for me,

0:52:43.100,0:52:45.140
because, you know, I'm deaf.

0:52:45.140,0:52:48.020
Like, awesome! First thing we did

0:52:48.480,0:52:50.960
how do you feel about having a meeting with us at Slack?

0:52:52.320,0:52:53.360
And so we real-time it.

0:52:53.360,0:52:54.860
We invited them as a single-channel guest.

0:52:55.080,0:52:58.580
We had that entire sales kind of conversation in Slack.

0:53:00.500,0:53:02.140
We were a hundred percent open to it.

0:53:02.140,0:53:03.780
We looked at it right away and said,

0:53:03.780,0:53:06.040
let's do this. Why wouldn't we do this?

0:53:07.960,0:53:11.520
So I want you to, and that's part of why I add this last piece here,

0:53:11.520,0:53:13.700
I want you to think about making one of your tools

0:53:14.140,0:53:17.620
or your processes more inclusive each month for the next year.

0:53:18.700,0:53:22.340
Those small changes that you make can actually be incredibly empowering

0:53:22.340,0:53:25.060
and even if you can't change all of them,

0:53:26.140,0:53:29.160
critically looking at the things that you have built into the way that you work

0:53:30.140,0:53:33.920
can actually uncover a lot of barriers in your own work and your own tools

0:53:33.920,0:53:40.600
that help you see things from a different perspective about the work that you're actually doing.

0:53:41.920,0:53:43.640
Hope that makes sense.

0:53:45.160,0:53:47.920
With that I'm gonna say, I'm done talking.

0:53:48.600,0:53:53.100
However, I know ... what do we ,what do we do from here, Dennis, are we gonna do Q&A?

0:53:53.140,0:53:57.240
I could talk until forever but i don't know how long we have this room.

0:53:57.240,0:54:02.140
[Dennis]:  [off mic]

0:54:02.260,0:54:05.400
[Derek]: So we'll do 10 minutes of Q&A, and then we can just hang out after that

0:54:05.400,0:54:09.280
[Dennis]: Yeah, so, Nick is going to pass the microphone to those who have questions,

0:54:10.400,0:54:12.340
and then we'll get it back to you.

0:54:12.340,0:54:14.340
[Derek]: Alright, I'm going to take water.

0:54:19.640,0:54:24.120
[Attendee]: Derek, first of all, this is Ray Campbell. Thank you for your presentation.

0:54:24.460,0:54:27.660
It hit all the notes that I am thinking of, as I think about my company.

0:54:29.300,0:54:33.160
I guess, the question that I would have for you,

0:54:33.160,0:54:37.080
and maybe you could help a little bit and impart some words of wisdom,

0:54:38.200,0:54:43.400
we may, in our work groups and stuff, want to do the right things,

0:54:43.400,0:54:46.140
they want to use tools and processes,

0:54:46.140,0:54:50.080
but how do we get that message up to leadership

0:54:50.080,0:54:55.660
that's making decisions about what tools we're going to use, what processes we're going to use?

0:54:55.660,0:55:01.900
But, oh, we're not going to do mobile right now because it's not required, and things like that?

0:55:02.580,0:55:07.380
And the second question is a little broader and that is,

0:55:08.340,0:55:14.540
what kinds of things do you think that the community of people with disabilities

0:55:14.540,0:55:20.240
and those who are interested in these subjects, need to do to get into the ear of people?

0:55:20.600,0:55:24.860
We now have a lawsuit against the eats our restaurant chain in New York,

0:55:24.860,0:55:29.840
because nobody thought, they put in iPads for ordering food and stuff.

0:55:30.960,0:55:36.700
Somebody thought ... they even covered up ...  the Voiceover covered up

0:55:36.700,0:55:39.140
that will turn up the home button and then some do things on the iPad.

0:55:39.500,0:55:44.700
What do we need to do to get into these companies ears and get them to think inclusive?

0:55:50.320,0:55:52.660
[Derek]: That's a lot of questions all in one.

0:55:52.660,0:55:53.720
[Laughter]

0:55:53.720,0:55:57.200
[Derek]: I'm gonna try and give you the the short answer

0:55:58.100,0:56:00.680
I even forget what the first question was. What was the first question?

0:56:01.320,0:56:03.480
[Attendee]: Getting leadership to buy-in ...

0:56:03.480,0:56:05.000
[Derek]: Getting leadership buy-in.

0:56:05.480,0:56:07.480
I think your number one tool ...

0:56:12.080,0:56:14.360
... we've used this method a lot and it works.

0:56:14.360,0:56:17.400
It may not work for everyone, your mileage may vary.

0:56:17.740,0:56:24.100
And I also have to admit that because I work for somebody that's not at the organization,

0:56:25.920,0:56:27.800
people listen to me more.

0:56:28.520,0:56:32.480
And I don't necessarily like that, I don't.

0:56:33.140,0:56:35.360
But that's just reality, right?

0:56:35.580,0:56:39.740
That is the reality of the stuff that we need to deal with every day.

0:56:40.100,0:56:43.620
I can come in and say exactly the same thing that you have been for 10 years

0:56:43.840,0:56:47.720
and in ten minutes I can get more action, simply because I'm from the outside.

0:56:48.920,0:56:52.720
And as a Canadian, I will just say I'm sorry for that.

0:56:52.720,0:56:53.880
[Laughter]

0:56:53.880,0:56:55.460
[Derek]: That's just how it is, though.

0:56:56.340,0:56:59.000
Number one tool that we use is video evidence.

0:57:00.460,0:57:07.840
People absolutely struggling with this stuff, and not just one video, not just two videos,

0:57:08.280,0:57:15.300
but videos that happen every single time you do usability testing with people with disabilities,

0:57:15.580,0:57:19.300
those videos make their way into every part of the culture.

0:57:21.340,0:57:26.460
Those videos are real, and they are painful, and they wake leadership up.

0:57:27.040,0:57:30.360
Whether we ... you know ... and I don't like doing that kind of like,

0:57:30.360,0:57:35.440
we're gonna put this on display because there's like even kind of icky feelings about that,

0:57:35.440,0:57:37.440
but man does it get the job done.

0:57:38.140,0:57:40.060
So we use videos for almost everything.

0:57:40.060,0:57:43.580
We record, we record sessions and we show them like

0:57:43.980,0:57:47.780
here's your engaging experience and here's why it sucks.

0:57:48.680,0:57:51.440
That thing that you thought, you know, ...

0:57:51.440,0:57:55.300
the other tool that we use is we get executive and leadership to kind of like,

0:57:55.760,0:57:59.980
predict how it will take for somebody to do this thing, right?

0:57:59.980,0:58:04.800
They are like, you know, it's like product management or like VP's of product and things like that,

0:58:04.800,0:58:07.860
how long do you think it's gonna take for this person to do "X"?

0:58:09.140,0:58:15.360
You know, to check out a book or to check to see if a book is in stock in the library,

0:58:15.360,0:58:17.220
Or if it's in the library or not.

0:58:17.480,0:58:20.740
To reserve that book, how long do you think that's going to take?

0:58:21.060,0:58:23.300
That should take like 45 seconds.

0:58:23.740,0:58:27.520
And then you show them reality where there's somebody with a disability,

0:58:27.520,0:58:34.980
and probably even people without a disability and it's not taking 45 seconds, it's actually taking five minutes.

0:58:34.980,0:58:38.220
And for someone with a disability, it's taking 17 minutes.

0:58:39.440,0:58:41.440
And the stuff has evidence all the time.

0:58:41.940,0:58:45.960
The second part of your question was what can we do as the community ...

0:58:46.360,0:58:50.700
to ... was it to get the same buy-in or was it a different ...

0:58:50.700,0:58:57.340
[Attendee]: [Indecipherable]

0:58:57.640,0:58:59.000
[Derek]: Right right right right ...

0:58:59.980,0:59:01.980
Companies don't know what proactive means.

0:59:02.780,0:59:05.560
Because they're all being asked to do too much with too little.

0:59:06.440,0:59:10.740
So that's the reality of the problem with that.

0:59:10.740,0:59:15.880
So anything that we do, and again I think it's, in many ways, it's evidence,

0:59:17.080,0:59:21.300
it's not proactive, they're gonna be reactive once,

0:59:23.040,0:59:25.200
and then after that, if it's worked well,

0:59:26.240,0:59:30.340
they're not going to be reactive in that same kind of life cycle.

0:59:30.340,0:59:32.340
They're going to start to become more proactive.

0:59:32.620,0:59:34.620
But I also think that we can't just say,

0:59:35.580,0:59:39.600
we're expecting you to be completely proactive about absolutely everything now.

0:59:40.040,0:59:41.420
We have to be ...

0:59:43.220,0:59:47.300
we have to keep going at it and going at it and going at it, it's ... think of Agile,

0:59:47.300,0:59:52.200
and I talked about this in my my talk earlier today at An Event Apart here in Chicago,

0:59:53.840,0:59:57.240
we've got to eliminate the idea of being perfect,

0:59:57.640,1:00:01.860
and really focus on better and getting better and better and better and better and better.

1:00:03.720,1:00:06.700
I don't think lawsuits are going to go away and I think they help,

1:00:06.700,1:00:08.240
but that's like the stick.

1:00:08.480,1:00:11.880
And there's other ways to do it with the carrot as well.

1:00:12.100,1:00:17.060
And dealing with and showing demonstrably some of the benefits of things as well.

1:00:17.460,1:00:20.760
I'm not sure if that's a community, what can you do as a community answer,

1:00:21.000,1:00:25.900
but it's certainly the way that we certainly approach it so I hope that's helpful.

1:00:39.240,1:00:43.260
[Attendee]: So my question is ... when we're talking about people with disabilities,

1:00:43.260,1:00:46.120
we're not just talking about, oh yeah, there are blind people, there are deaf people,

1:00:46.120,1:00:49.520
there are people in wheelchairs, there's a full range of disability, right?

1:00:49.520,1:00:55.860
[Indecipherable]

1:00:55.860,1:01:00.880
How do you account for that entire range of disability when designing your product?

1:01:00.880,1:01:04.560
Because there is so much out there that you need to account for.

1:01:12.740,1:01:14.580
Ranges and spectrums.

1:01:15.740,1:01:18.360
A lot of people ... if I were to ask you to draw a spectrum,

1:01:19.500,1:01:22.520
and I'll ask you to do this, draw me what a spectrum looks like.

1:01:23.200,1:01:26.900
When we say somebody's on the autistic spectrum, what does that look like?

1:01:26.900,1:01:28.360
Draw that in the air for me.

1:01:29.100,1:01:31.860
Or don't, that's fine too, I'm totally fine with not ...

1:01:32.240,1:01:34.360
Almost everybody does something like this ...

1:01:35.000,1:01:36.400
... or they do this, right?

1:01:37.560,1:01:42.760
And one of the most helpful things for me was to understand that it's actually more like this.

1:01:43.780,1:01:48.340
Then it's not about being some spot between two end points on the line ...

1:01:48.580,1:01:51.080
that it's actually ... and I don't have this slide in here, so I can't show you,

1:01:51.080,1:01:53.640
but I have a slide where it's basically a color wheel.

1:01:53.880,1:01:58.800
And there's five different kind of functional things around it and we all exist ...

1:01:58.920,1:02:05.000
... if you think of your verbal skills, your auditory skills, your executive function,

1:02:05.000,1:02:08.220
which is kind of what helps control whether you like,

1:02:08.220,1:02:11.680
I shouldn't say this thing right now or I should say this thing right now,

1:02:12.060,1:02:23.040
your people skills, your empathy skills, all of those things all exist on their independent kind of lines.

1:02:23.040,1:02:25.740
But they actually are a multi-dimensional whole.

1:02:25.740,1:02:28.760
So I think an important part of this is thinking about it that way.

1:02:29.020,1:02:35.860
The other part of it is not thinking about the ridiculous number of

1:02:36.420,1:02:41.020
infinite combinations that there are in terms of what disability actually means

1:02:41.020,1:02:45.380
and what that means for somebody's hearing or their sight or their whatever it is.

1:02:45.860,1:02:47.720
Think of it in functional terms.

1:02:48.140,1:02:57.060
So, don't think of five different forms of colorblindness, and someone that's completely blind,

1:02:57.060,1:03:00.900
or somebody that has low vision, that it's very blurry and so they can't tell about the color,

1:03:01.440,1:03:05.160
don't think about ... we have to design for someone that's red-green deficient,

1:03:05.160,1:03:09.360
somebody that has difficulty with blue and yellow, somebody that can't see color at all,

1:03:09.580,1:03:12.840
and somebody that can really struggle seeing the color,

1:03:13.980,1:03:20.480
think of not all the individual things but think of it as a broader thing like

1:03:20.760,1:03:22.760
how do I do this so the color doesn't matter?

1:03:24.360,1:03:30.460
When you think of all of the things that way, like almost every kind of neurodiversity or cognitive thing

1:03:31.520,1:03:34.860
relates to one of a few functional things, like

1:03:36.180,1:03:42.680
there's, I'm gonna really extract like be really superlative here, but

1:03:43.760,1:03:48.260
there's zillions of reasons for having short-term memory problems.

1:03:50.200,1:03:51.560
Like zillions.

1:03:51.560,1:03:52.320
Concussion.

1:03:53.240,1:03:54.400
Alzheimer's.

1:03:54.400,1:03:57.580
I can't remember anymore ... so you see what I did there?

1:03:57.580,1:03:59.580
[Attendee]: Short term, you could have a hangover ...

1:03:59.860,1:04:03.740
[Derek]: Well, I wasn't gonna say hangover but, I totally, it's the same thing.

1:04:03.740,1:04:06.400
You haven't had your coffee in the morning yet, right?

1:04:07.020,1:04:09.720
All of those things are related to memory.

1:04:09.720,1:04:11.380
It doesn't matter why it's there.

1:04:12.220,1:04:14.220
It matters that there's a short-term memory issue, 

1:04:14.780,1:04:20.140
and so what we do is we find ways to design better for people that are having difficulties with short-term memory.

1:04:21.360,1:04:22.800
I hope that it helps.

1:04:23.080,1:04:27.140
Don't think about the zillions of things, think about the functional impact of those things

1:04:27.140,1:04:29.140
and focus on those.

1:04:29.580,1:04:31.180
[Attendee]: Can I just build on that?

1:04:31.180,1:04:35.020
[Dennis]: Sure, one second, let's get you a microphone so everyone can hear you.

1:04:35.300,1:04:37.460
[Attendee]: I just wanted to add to his short term memory.

1:04:37.460,1:04:41.000
When people under lots of stress, so they're going through health issues,

1:04:41.560,1:04:44.740
then they have sometimes cognitive problems.

1:04:44.740,1:04:48.800
You're going through emotional event, somebody's sick, somebody's dying,

1:04:49.340,1:04:54.720
just imagine being online, going to a website it's so complicated that you can't think straight.

1:04:55.220,1:05:01.320
So these issues of disability aren't necessarily something that's chronic or a long term.

1:05:01.320,1:05:04.600
It can be short term, they can be just instantaneous.

1:05:04.920,1:05:09.880
So when you think of Universal Design, it can be design for everything, for everybody,

1:05:10.640,1:05:15.920
a little bit of perspective a lot of times you're creating about your experience for everybody,

1:05:15.920,1:05:19.700
under different conditions. I just wanted to add that.

1:05:21.260,1:05:24.520
[Derek]:  [warble] ... not even just sometimes like all the time right but

1:05:26.420,1:05:29.260
The cool part about it is that

1:05:30.940,1:05:36.560
if I'm, you know, crack my head and I'm suddenly can't remember something and that's gonna come back,

1:05:37.160,1:05:40.640
you know that the things that we do

1:05:41.820,1:05:44.360
to create inclusion and accessibility

1:05:44.980,1:05:47.320
aren't really for me, they just happen to benefit me.

1:05:48.140,1:05:51.500
That's not something for me that is protected as a civil right

1:05:52.740,1:05:58.700
and the beauty of doing the things that we do from an accessibility perspective and inclusion perspective

1:06:00.000,1:06:02.160
... for as the main reason for people with disabilities,

1:06:02.480,1:06:04.340
it happens to benefit lots of other people.

1:06:04.580,1:06:07.780
but it's a civil right of people with disabilities.

1:06:08.180,1:06:11.460
 And so there is an important distinction I want you to think about there,

1:06:11.920,1:06:16.620
but definitely use the ... sell it as much as you need to with the ... 

1:06:16.860,1:06:23.640
this benefits everybody, but it's actually a you know a civil right for people that actually have disabilities.

1:06:24.160,1:06:26.160
So, think about that side of it as well.

1:06:26.480,1:06:27.740
[Dennis]: One more question.

1:06:28.100,1:06:29.500
[Derek]: Just one more.

1:06:36.820,1:06:39.360
[Attendee]: Hi, Derek, that was a great presentation.

1:06:39.360,1:06:46.960
Actually, this is my first accessible presentation ... I didn't know accessibility in design.

1:06:46.960,1:06:52.400
So, really fascinated by it. So, understanding your presentation,

1:06:52.400,1:07:00.060
I just wanted to ask you one thing, that when I design a solution for people who are not disabled,

1:07:00.060,1:07:03.160
how do I paint accessibility?

1:07:03.160,1:07:06.520
How do I think that, okay, what is the starting point?

1:07:06.520,1:07:14.380
Because how do I think that, okay, now I have to make it accessible to other people who are not able to see,

1:07:14.380,1:07:16.980
or hear, or other disability.

1:07:16.980,1:07:19.260
How do I paint accessibility?

1:07:19.260,1:07:24.580
Because, in my mind, I'm designing a solution for people which are, you know, not disabled,

1:07:24.580,1:07:31.120
and then how do I think, what is my starting point, what is the tool that I use that, now I have to make it inclusive

1:07:31.120,1:07:34.080
all inclusive, for people who cannot use this.

1:07:34.680,1:07:40.240
So I just want to know, as being an entry to the design field.

1:07:45.360,1:07:50.960
[Derek]: So that is like a full-day workshop, is like what the starting point is.

1:07:50.960,1:07:52.440
Because there's a lot to it.

1:07:52.660,1:07:54.220
However, let me say this.

1:07:55.520,1:07:59.520
When you design with empathy,

1:08:01.220,1:08:05.820
and an understanding of what people that aren't in your shoes are actually going through

1:08:06.560,1:08:10.380
and I've got some things that I can share with you as well, that are actual like,

1:08:11.200,1:08:13.900
here's an inclusive design tool kit that will help you.

1:08:14.440,1:08:15.920
right, to understand that.

1:08:15.920,1:08:18.560
so that's a thing that we can talk about later.

1:08:18.580,1:08:21.860
But, when you design with empathy and I really want,

1:08:22.300,1:08:26.120
I really need to make this distinction, I hope you all understand the difference.

1:08:26.620,1:08:29.280
There's a difference between ... 

1:08:29.280,1:08:34.160
there's a difference between designing with empathy and designing with sympathy.

1:08:35.480,1:08:38.120
They are incredibly different things.

1:08:40.020,1:08:42.480
Use that as your starting point,

1:08:43.000,1:08:46.880
and if you take empathy on and really understand what that means,

1:08:47.160,1:08:49.160
that's what leads you down the correct path.

1:08:50.180,1:08:53.840
There are simple things that we can talk about as well from a design perspective

1:08:53.840,1:08:57.100
that can actually help create that empathy.

1:08:58.000,1:09:02.960
And there's lots of things that help on that helped the developers with it as well.

1:09:03.260,1:09:06.680
But, that to me is a great starting point.

1:09:07.000,1:09:09.460
There's a lots of resources that you can find but that mindset,

1:09:10.280,1:09:13.020
understanding that accessibility is non-binary,

1:09:13.800,1:09:15.920
right, that there's a lot of shades of grey in between,

1:09:17.080,1:09:20.320
that it's not just about, did we meet the requirement,

1:09:22.500,1:09:24.500
is this actually easy to use.

1:09:26.180,1:09:30.460
That to me, that mindset is what will take you a long long way.

1:09:33.520,1:09:35.680
Alright, thank you very much, everybody.

1:09:35.680,1:09:40.800
[Applause]

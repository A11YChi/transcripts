The Chicago Digital Accessibility &amp; Inclusive Design Meetup presents,"What's Law Got to Do with It, Access as a Civil Right," with Lainey Feingold.

**[Lainey]:** Ok. Thank you, Dennis. Dennis is amazing, you're very lucky to have him in Chicago.

Can everybody hear me? I think ... [tapping finger on mic]. Oh, the podium mic ... Ohhh ... Podium mic?

**[Dennis]:** Check, check ...

**[Lainey]:** Oh ... Okay ... oh boy, can I just hold this? Okay, that's better. Okay, well, thank you for coming.

In my view, if you're here, and you're a part of the Accessibility Chicago meetup, you are an Accessibility Champion. So, really, sometimes it's so hard to do this work. And you're doing it, you're here, so thank you.

This is gonna be about law what does law I have to do with it and the basic answer, if you have to leave right now is right on the title page which says what's law got to do with it, access as a civil right. And that's what we're going to talk about.

So I have up here my Twitter, which is LFLegal. I really think Twitter is a great place for accessibility information and I tweet about accessibility issues around law, as well as about structured negotiation which is the collaborative way that I practice law. I also my website up here which is LFLegal.com. I have a lot of legal information, not just about the work that I do, but the work that everybody's doing around the country, in the legal space. Really trying to support you guys. Because you're where it's really happening. And the legal space is trying to help you in it in its best form. So, let's get started.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.760
Ok, so I like the idea of putting the law in your pocket.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.760
So are any of you lawyers, besides me?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.820
No, okay..

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.720
So this is great that you wonder about the law and I support you

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.040
and think that the law is something that we all need to put in our pocket.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.740
We have to be able to talk about the law.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.540
I like this picture of the pocket that I have

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.040
with the scissors and tool ... tape measure

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.940
and a pencil.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.060
Because the law is the same thing.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.620
It shouldn't be something foreign and outside,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.900
locked away in a law book or in a big building,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.360
even though we appreciate the ABA for hosting us in this building.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.700
The law is something that we all need

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.060
and we have to learn how to talk about it in a way that can help you do your job.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.740
And that's really why I do these accessibility meetups,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.300
and I've done it in San Francisco and Toronto, because I really do feel you guys are on the front lines,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.860
and the law can help you, when your head is against the wall and you need to convince someone for more funding,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.060
or you need to motivate your team.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.560
Law is not the only thing, well I shouldn't be the first thing, but the law is there to help you.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.840
And then, the third thing to put in your pocket that I'm hoping you'll walk away with.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.780
I going to ask you a question first.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.320
So, if I'd say, oh we're gonna talk about the law today,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.700
do you get a feeling like, oh my god, that's so exciting, I can't wait

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.500
or do you like,  oh the law, you know the law is it like something that you're afraid of?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.960
or is it something that feels motivational?

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.580
Which word is more like the law, fear or motivation?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.400
Fear.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.460
Most people said fear.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.940
The one people who didn't say fear, good thank you.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.120
Yeah, so how can we shift from fear to motivation?

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.740
Because, yeah, you can motivate people, you know, with the stick and being afraid and threats,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.040
but I really don't think that is the kind of motivation we want to give over,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.820
and I don't think it's as effective.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.260
So, that's what the goal is for tonight,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.720
is that you can walk away, being able to talk about the law in the accessibility space,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.540
help you do your job and be able to shift from fear to motivation.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.040
And the main way to do that, again, if you have to leave right now,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.260
the main way is right here in this first slide that says

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.180
accessibility is about people.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.380
And there's a picture here that I got from a website

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.500
from the Mobility International USA,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.280
which is a non-profit group

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.320
that brings women from around the world to do various accessibility and disability programs.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.380
And there's women from all around the world, high-fiving, hands up.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.860
Accessibility is about people.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.880
So I think we all know, it's not about checklists, it's certainly not about the law, it's about people.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.520
And whatever your role is ...

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.080
and there's lots of different roles.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.780
We heard some of them earlier, but we didn't get to hear from everyone.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.700
Whatever your role is, you can make that role.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.500
You can make that role about people.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.500
So, what kind of people?

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.760
I just made one list here of the kind of people that the law has,

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.300
that have been part of the accessibility legal space.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.460
People, who, a lot of you guys call "users" and as lawyers, we call them "clients."

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.920
And, I don't know what other terms, personas when they're not actual people, but kind of a sub for people.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.600
We're talking about students.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.520
We're talking about shoppers, patients,

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.360
customers,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.200
people who pay taxes, investors,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.280
employees, applicants,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.500
fans like baseball fans and sports fans,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.780
citizens, members of the public,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.540
transit riders, diners, people who eat in restaurants,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.580
homeowners, lawyers and clients.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.940
So, all these different categories of people are people whose accessibility needs

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.300
have been impacted in the legal space.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.800
So, is that ... do any of you work with any other categories of people that they didn't hit up here?

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.220
That you know you need to make your work accessible because ...

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.540
... say ...

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.880
[Attendee speaking away from mic]

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.060
[Lainey]: Yeah, so there was just an affirmation of patients needing accessibility.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.600
The audience member works at Northwestern and raising awareness.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.540
So, that's the main thing whenever you're stuck,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.180
it's really about people and this is what you're doing it for.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.160
So, accessibility is a civil right of disabled people.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.460
I illustrate this with a picture of a march leading up to the ADA.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.880
It says, to save people into a march, with a flat ... with a banner saying

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.760
"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere," which is a Martin Luther King quote.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.360
Because, accessibility is a civil right.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.040
It's good for a lot of other things and I'm sure a lot of your other meetups talk about that.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.740
You know, SEO and it's easier to find things, it's easier for everyone to read, seniors need accessibility,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.420
but the legal space is about disabled people,

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.760
people with disabilities who have a civil right to information and participation.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.720
So, that's really the key,

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.780
sort of legal thing to have in your pocket.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.820
about accessibility being a civil right.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.860
And still, the first picture I showed was before the ADA, which was passed in 1990.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.940
And this one is 27 years ago, a march just like two months ago,

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.300
to protect people with disabilities right to healthcare.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:24.080
So, the civil rights issue is on basic things, like the right to live in the community, the right to health care

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.400
and everything you are doing in the accessibility space, the right to fly in an airplane,

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.980
the right to make a reservation,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:35.380
the right to have your taxes paid without having to show someone your private bank account,

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.800
the right to bank of course,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.140
all of this has to do with civil rights of people.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.900
And that is part of your role, that is what you're doing.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.660
So why do we say that?

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.760
Because with accessibility we have participation inclusion and equality,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.000
and without accessibility, we have like this woman looking in from outside,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.360
people are left out, excluded and discriminated against.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.100
And that is why the legal space is even involved.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.880
That's why we're even ... that's why I'm a lawyer that does digital accessibility.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.740
Accessibility is also right to information.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.360
The Americans with Disabilities Act is really clear that if you're giving out information to the public,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.440
or your customers, your employment, whatever, that information has to be available for everyone

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.920
and not everybody can see and not everybody can hear and not everybody can use a mouse,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.460
which you guys all know because you're in this space.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.600
So accessibility is a right to information about

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.440
education, transit, voting, all the same things.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.880
Finance, healthcare, retail, employment, community,

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.020
sports, and we could have five slides about this.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.920
And the right to participate in these things as well.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.980
So why be afraid of that?

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.520
Like how did this happen, that the law suddenly became something to be afraid of,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:54.060
when it's about including people in the broadest group of people that there are in the work that we're doing.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:01.920
So the legal equation for access, that's the sort of kind of big picture issue that

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.000
accessibility is a civil right and you guys are all civil rights champions by doing this work

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.140
and a couple people said before that they're frustrated and they may be shut down on emails or phone calls

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.340
or people, you know, roll your eyes because, oh you're asking for money for access again.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:23.040
But remember, you are part of a community, a global community, really, that is fighting for access.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.320
So that's the foundation, that's a core foundation,

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.920
but without advocates,

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.700
without people with disabilities, who are fighting for their rights

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
and without strategies, without the who and the how,

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.560
we just have a foundation and nothing else.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:43.320
So the combination of foundation and advocates and strategies equals accessibility wins,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.440
And that's what I want to talk about next, in terms of what's happening in the legal space.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.340
The laws are the foundation.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.440
We have a very  strong foundation

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.320
for accessibility, and you know I'm just gonna really

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.840
take off my watch, so I can stay on time,

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.360
and just kind of quickly go through the foundation.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.060
We have US laws and policies and we have state laws and policies.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:14.120
In terms of US Federal, we of course have the Americans with Disabilities Act,

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:21.060
which covers the public sector, the private sector as well as employment, we have federally funded activities,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:27.100
if the federal government is gonna give money to universities or colleges or transit systems or

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.320
parks or any sort of program, they gotta include everybody.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.960
And that's why section 504 says it's discrimination if you use federal funds

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.580
and don't use it in a way that includes everybody.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.760
So that's where you come in.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.040
If you're working for any sort of environment, in any sort of

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.720
sector environment that has federal funding,

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:52.820
there's also federal employment, that's Section 501 and 503, which prevents discrimination.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.800
Any law that prevents discrimination, requires accessibility.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.700
Because in the digital age, without accessibility, you are leaving people out.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.440
That is ... it's not like, someone earlier said, it's a gray area.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.380
Not really gray when you think about it like that.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.180
Because everything's online now.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.500
There's no choice, it's not like online ...

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.440
When Kelly and I first started in this, online banking was a little sliver

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.940
and maybe an argument could be made,

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.440
oh well, you can use the phone, or you can go in or branch.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.820
It is not like that anymore.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:32.760
Everything is ... and these laws are designed, even the old ones even the laws before there was a web,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.340
they were designed for inclusion.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.620
And accessibility means inclusion .

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.180
So federal procurement, excuse me, procurement,

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.480
which many of you know, section 508 has to do with federal purchases,

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:49.200
the airlines have a special law for making sure that airline websites and kiosks are accessible.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.160
But do we have regulations?

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:56.620
Now, how many of you have been in conversations, well there's no web regulations, so it's a gray area.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.380
Have any of you been ...yeah, some of you maybe four or five people.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.500
So, the Americans with Disabilities Act is a law

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:11.340
and most laws, then, have regulations to flesh out what does the law really mean, what are people required to do.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.580
So the ADA itself, in my view, in the view of growing number of courts,

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.840
requires websites, mobile apps, kiosks, technology to be accessible,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.140
because without it, people are left out.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.400
And that's really ... the law, to have in your pocket .

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:33.440
It's not that complicated to understand that the ADA was designed as a broad law of inclusion.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.240
So then we do have regulations in the ADA that say companies, governments,

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.540
have to effectively communicate.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.720
And in this day in age, like I say, you cannot effectively communicate unless your website is accessible.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.100
Already, have regulations that say, effective communication means technology has to be accessible.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.280
We already have that.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:13:02.900
What we don't have is specific regulations that say, in order to be accessible, you should meet WCAG 2.0 AA,

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.460
or you should have a certain kind of training.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.920
We don't have that sort of detail, which I know would help you in your jobs.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.540
But, we do not have it, which is why I have this red circle with a line through it.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.520
We do not have those web regulations.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.360
We are probably not going to see them in our lifetime.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.340
I don't know ... you know, they were proposed in 2010,

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:30.040
they didn't make it out as official regulations during the Obama administration.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.640
They are now in inactive status.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.740
So basically, what I say about that is that the web regulations are inactive but the ADA is not.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.640
So don't let anyone say to you

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.380
there are no regulations, we don't know what to do.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:50.340
Because as you'll see in a minute, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA,

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.280
that is a universally accepted standard.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:59.240
It's used in Section 508 for federal procurement, it's used for airline access,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:06.540
it's used by people who litigate cases and settle them, it's used in structured negotiation,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:12.340
in all the cases I've done, about 30 cases on web accessibility, it's always been the standard.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.180
So, that is the way to make websites accessible, one aspect of it.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.640
That's the coding standard. There are other things we'll talk about pretty soon.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.140
So, the web regulations are inactive, the ADA isn't.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.800
And that's a really good thing to have in your pocket, too.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.220
Because, what happens is these issues, because it's a lot of lawsuits being filed,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.320
they're in your companies or your agencies, they're ending up in the lawyer offices.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.140
Not good. Accessibility should not be in lawyer offices.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:48.160
Even like my own. Really, the best thing for accessibility is to be with you guys, who are doing the work.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.860
But because there's so many lawsuits,

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.940
it's more and more in the law offices and then you get these lawyers who don't know that much about it,

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.920
look it up say there's no web regs we don't have to do accessibility.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.100
Not true.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.840
Okay, there's also state laws.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.080
I have a map of the United States here with a patchwork of colors for each state.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.780
Because, there is a patchwork of laws.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.920
Every state has its own laws, including Illinois,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.840
requiring state-funded IT information technology to be accessible,

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.320
requiring state procurement,

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.720
again, when state money is used for things,

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.180
everyone in the state needs to be included.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.340
Illinois has their Information Technology Act,

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.340
which is like the Illinois 508.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.180
There are state anti-discrimination laws,

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.420
there's an Illinois Human Rights Act,

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.200
all these laws are part of the foundation.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.680
And Chicago has a Human Rights Ordinance.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.560
Part of the foundation, like we saw before with the federal laws,

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.680
that give advocates tools to make sure technology is accessible to them.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.400
And beyond the US, I know we're not really getting deep into the law detail here,

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.760
but I wanted to put this up, because you guys are really part of a global movement.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.300
And I know sometimes when we're in our own cubicles or in my own office, you know in Berkeley,

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.060
it's really easy to forget that.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.360
And I think it's important to remember that, because,

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:23.120
in my view, the law, even if we ... you know, just terrible things happen in the next four years,

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.360
given the administration, we can't change the tide.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.360
The tide of this is not going to change.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.320
Because, all over the world,

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.640
there are laws and regulations and people doing just what you're doing here in Chicago

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.520
to make the web a more accessible place.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.180
And so there's foundation beyond the US with the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities,

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.220
they have a section in there, Article 9, that says IT has to be accessible.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.000
173 countries have ratified that.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.520
Did that treaty, of course, we have not.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.440
But, you know, we have the ADA, which some countries, you know, most countries don't have.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.640
If your interested in the federal law, Dennis you can have these slides up on ...

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:08.760
[Dennis]: [Indecipherable]

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.080
[Lainey]: Okay, the slides will be incorporated in the recording,

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.360
so, I have the links here, the Web Content Accessibility ...

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:19.420
the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative keeps a list of international laws.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.480
I keep one, that I rely on international people I know from Twitter to update.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:27.800
So, if you're ever get like get down and think you're the only one like in this,

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.360
like remember that you're part of a global movement here.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.500
And again, accessibility is about people.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.560
I have the same smiling people here.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.340
And those people are also advocates, because without advocates,

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.880
you have the foundation, which I have in this picture.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.880
Really strong foundation, cement blocks, really strong, it's not going away.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.800
Without advocates and strategies, that that's all you have.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.800
You don't have implementation.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.420
So now, I want to talk about what's happening in the US on strategies for enforcing

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.020
civil rights of people with disabilities.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.640
So the advocates toolbox.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.360
I so believe in this, that I carry around my toolbox.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:12.800
Everywhere I go, I carry my toolbox, which has a lot of tools in it.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.360
Because there's a lot of different ways to enforce these laws, and

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.640
a lot ... I don't ... I'm not going to take a poll or ask,

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.140
but you know there's a lot of lawsuits being filed right now

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.720
and a lot of people feel that there's too many lawsuits.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.800
The lawsuits are obviously the hammer.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.320
The way that I work and work with Kelly and others, which we'll talk about in a minute,

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.720
it's called Structured Negotiation.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.940
It's more collaborative. I haven't exactly figured out what tool it is.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:42.560
It's not like a ... it's not like a saw, I'm really sure, but I know it's not the hammer.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.780
If you feel like the strategy ... I don't like the lawsuits,

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:55.720
be careful that your opinion is limited to the strategy and don't ... it's all too easy to, uh, too many lawsuits.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.260
The law shouldn't help us.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
No, the law is critical.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.720
The law of civil rights of disabled people is critical.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:09.860
If some lawyer is misusing the foundation, then let's talk about that lawyer and how to keep them in check.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.480
Let's not talk about dismantling, as some people do, the foundation.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.360
So, I'm really into the tool box and there's three basic tools that are being used

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.720
and have been used for the past really seventeen years.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.740
Which I guess now is a good time to tell you, answer a question that came up earlier,

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:33.920
how did I get into this and why do the banks have accessibility.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.320
So, one of the tools in the toolbox is Structured Negotiation.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:44.200
And that's a way of working with big companies, small companies, government agencies, without lawsuits,

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.060
in collaboration. It all started in the early 90s

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.060
when some blind people came to me and my colleagues in California and said,

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.880
there's not a single ATM we can use in the United States.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.120
Because there were no talking ATMs anywhere in the world.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.780
And so, we could have filed a lawsuit, but we didn't.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.500
We wrote letters to Bank America, Wells Fargo and Citibank in 1995.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.760
Ok, I'm aging myself, but that's okay.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.020
With age comes wisdom. I'm trying to ...

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.800
... I'm trying to start owning that.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:21.840
We wrote those letters in 1995 and then by 1999, and I tell all these stories in my book,

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.960
by 1999, all those three banks had talking ATMs.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.280
Well, beginning 1999, 2000, 2001,

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.940
and the reason was that structured negotiation is a person-centered,

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.680
it's about people, the same way as accessibility it's about people,

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.120
and blind people, such as Kelly, and I'm gonna get to Kelly cares in a minute here,

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.220
we were in talking ATM labs and blind people were working with the developers,

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:51.760
just like I really want to encourage you to get disabled people into your labs, into your companies,

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.600
every chance.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.860
And that's why we got talking ATMs.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.860
So in 1998 about,

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:02.140
some of our clients came to us and said we're making really good progress on the talking ATMs,

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.120
but there's a new thing called online banking.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.940
And, like I said before, online banking is not accessible.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.800
So, we got the first agreement with Bank America in 2000.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:17.400
So for 17 years, Bank of America has been committed to web accessibility, along with Chase here in Chicago,

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.680
some of the early banks.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.300
So after we got Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank,

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:29.660
Kelly Pierce, who's sitting in the front row here, who is blind, called us and said, well what about Chicago?

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.220
Like what are we, chopped liver?

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.900
Can you bring this stuff? Because these weren't national banks yet.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:41.200
So we came to Chicago, we worked with Bank One, they too got the talking ATMs and the accessible website.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.860
And it was the very first time we used this word Structured Negotiation.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.220
With the California banks, it was kind of luck.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.860
We wrote the letters instead of the lawsuit. They said, yes. Part of me thought it was luck.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.940
Then we named this thing and we used it for the first time,

00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.480
and here in Chicago, it really took root, structured negotiation.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.920
And, we went on to do it in a lot of other cases which we'll talk about in a minute.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.220
So I'm a fan of structured negotiation.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:12.620
I wrote the book to share with people the stories ... they're mostly, they're not mostly,

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.300
there are a hundred percent about blind technology,

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.660
websites, talking prescription labels, mostly about websites.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.740
I really believe in the method.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.060
It's always been my first strategy that I talk about when I do slides.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.160
However ...

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.980
this year, three months ago, I switched the first strategy to lawsuits.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:38.420
Not because I believe in the hammer, because I think the hammer can be useful, lawsuits can be really useful,

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.020
especially in this political time we find ourselves in,

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:47.040
but poor web accessibility, it's so much about people and in a lawsuit, all the people get lost.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.640
The users, your UX people, the users, the clients,

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.940
the people, they get the name of plaintiff and nobody listens to them.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.120
The people who really know stuff, like you guys, you don't really get a role,

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.120
because your lawyers are doing all the talking.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.760
So, I really like structured negotiations best, I still think it's first.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.180
However, there's a lot of lawsuits happening

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.840
in the digital accessibility space, and I want to give it over to you.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.420
So, there's lawsuits in federal and state court, federal agency complaints is another,

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.040
US strategy and structured negotiation.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.360
So, there are foundational lawsuits and, again, this is it really a gray area,

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:31.420
saying that accessibility is required by US law and those main lawsuits are Target,

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.440
how many of you have heard that there was a lawsuit on ... yeah, most people have heard that

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.840
because that was really the first one in 2006

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.720
in federal court, the judge said, yeah, Target's website has to be accessible.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.840
Then, how many know there's a web case against Netflix?

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.200
Yes, fewer people every time I ask this question,

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.180
A lot of people know about Target, fewer people know about Netflix.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.820
Netflix was very important

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.420
because the judge of Massachusetts said all streaming content

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.660
needed to be accessible and Netflix doesn't have a physical place.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.120
So that's been this legal issue that, I don't get to legal about it, but,

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.360
oh, is a website only required to be accessible if there's a physical place?

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.860
The real thing you need to have in your pocket is different courts say different things.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:23.180
You only have one website so, Netflix and Scribd

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.660
which is ... how many people know there's a web accessibility case against Scribd?

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.680
Probably no one. Yes, see, oh ... well ...

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.600
That doesn't count, ADA, Kelly, experts in the field.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.640
Scribed is like a Netflix of magazines and books and, they too, don't have a place.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.080
And the judge also said great opinion.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.740
And I have all of these ... I have a legal update tab on my website

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:51.460
And you could see legal updates back for like the last four years and I always put the settlement links

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:56.080
to the settlement, to the press releases, to articles I write about it.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.300
So there's a lot of, I know you can't really get all the content you need for your pocket in the slides.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.200
Yeah?

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:07.600
[Attendee]: [Indecipherable]

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.860
[Lainey]: Well, the thing about precedent, you're asking,

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.260
the question was, do these things stand for precedent?

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:20.340
Is that ... yeah, so precedent in the law I think means something different than precedent in the world.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:28.400
So in the law, you only have precedent, like if these are Netflix, Target, Scribd,

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.000
also on the screen is Miami University, which I put as an example.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.620
There's a lot of good work, the National Federation of the Blind has done with universities.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:42.280
Lots of settlements that go in-depth and what's required to really have an accessible environment for students.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.320
And there's a voting button because there's been cases all around the country

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.720
to make sure ... they've mostly been around blind people's right to access voting websites,

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:58.360
and as more information goes online about voting, who the candidates are, but also online ballots.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.160
So to answer the question,

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.960
for Target, it's a district court, for Netflix, district court, which is the lowest federal level,

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.740
they really don't have precedent beyond ...

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.040
they don't even have precedent in their own districts,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.020
because recently, I'll tell, I will talk in a minute,

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.120
There was one district in central California,

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.920
where a judge threw out one web case and a different judge in the same district kept another web case.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:26.340
So you'll see in a minute, I have a slide of a rollercoaster.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.420
Cases with ... there's a lot of new lawyers coming in, filing cases,

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.140
we're gonna win some, we're gonna lose some.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.500
And the thing to remember is that for the reason I said

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.420
I think legal precedent is different what I call industry precedent that I know

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:48.120
from my, all I can tell you is what I know from 20 years, that when we first did those Bank talking ATM cases,

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.200
all the other banks followed the precedent.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.560
And the vendors, I was once in a conference on the raising hand well we have to do everything accessible

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.280
because we sell to Bank America.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.320
But that's not a legal precedent.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:05.900
That's Bank America ... bought into it because they met their clients and structured negotiation,

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.700
they're blind customers and they bought it real

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.560
and when you buy it real, you have to include it in all your vendor contracts.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.960
So I really believe in industry precedent.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.380
Talking prescription labels the same way, really hard to get one pharmacy to do it.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.660
But once we got one, people wanted to do it more.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:31.600
So I really think there's not a legal precedent of many of these cases.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.260
They're all in district, different circuits.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.700
The way it works in the federal system is 11 different circuits,

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.380
some of the circuits say you have to have a connection to a physical place.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.700
You have to be like a Target store.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:49.160
Other circuits, like Massachusetts, which is the First Circuit, where Netflix was, say

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.920
No, you don't have to have a physical place. Web sites have to be accessible regardless.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:59.400
So the US Supreme Court is the final, you know, arbiter on this.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.880
They've never had a case on it.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:07.220
In the near future, we have to hope they never do, because it's there it's extremely risky.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:15.000
I mean in this field, we have to be really careful about ... we should be really careful about the kind of cases we bring.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.460
But these are the foundational cases.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.560
I want to just tell you real quick about six new wins,

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.320
where I have a smiling child, looks to have Down syndrome,

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:27.340
with her thumbs up saying hooray for the six new wins.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:31.360
And those are cases against Winn-Dixie grocery store,

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.560
how many have heard there was a case against Winn-Dixie?

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.780
A few people. It's a grocery store.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.760
Winn-Dixie lost, the blind plaintiff won.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.740
It was the first trial in the United States where a judge,

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.200
not a jury but a judge,

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.420
listened to evidence and said

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.180
this grocery store should have had an accessible website.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.620
So the grocery store lost the case.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.000
Before you write down too many notes, you should know

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.340
it's now on appeal

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.220
to the Eleventh Circuit.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.900
Because that's how law works.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.160
You know, when you have a fight, there's a loser.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:10.560
In structured negotiation and no it sounds kind of pollyannaish, but it's really a win-win.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.180
And that has been, you know, my experience.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:19.480
So Winn-Dixie was in one of the circuits that said you have to have a physical place.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.000
So the plaintiff was able to show that

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.140
he went on the website to find the store locations,

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.080
but again, you have one website, if you're working for a company

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.540
you can't really rely on the fact that some courts say you need a physical place.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:39.620
Hobby Lobby and Blick Art Materials are two ... in both these cases we're about websites.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.460
They have not been appealed yet, but the time hasn't run out, so it may happen.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:53.960
The Blick Art Materials ... these are both ... ok, here's another thing that happens in law.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.580
There's a lot of skirmishes before the battle is over.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:02.160
So, all of these cases, except well, Winn-Dixie, was a trial,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:08.260
but the rest, what happens, somebody files a lawsuit, the company files an aggressive lawyer to respond,

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.540
and then they try to throw the case out of court.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.280
And so, when I say Hobby Lobby is a win,

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.060
it means Hobby Lobby tried to throw the case out of court and the judge said no.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.700
The case can stay in the court.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.760
The judge didn't decide, it should be WCAG.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:26.860
They didn't decide, even it's too expensive, it's not ... they didn't decide anything, except the case can stay in court.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.300
But that shows us at the ADA covers it

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.320
and it's so expensive to do this legal fighting.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.740
I mean, spend money on access, not lawyers.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.380
This is like, I need to make us ...

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.080
you maybe can ask that sticker company to make a sticker for that.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.040
Spend money on access, because ...

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.360
even if you end up winning the case, you paid the lawyers so much money,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.700
and it's just, it's not cost-effective.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.140
Blick Art Materials, I really recommend if you have time and you can look on my website for the link,

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.820
the opinion was written by a 96 year old judge in New York.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.960
Thank God he stayed on the bench.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:06.780
And he got accessibility ... you know, you think on 96 he's not going to get it.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:10.840
He's like, we live in an age where this can be done.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.160
Like, why aren't they doing it?

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.140
I think he said, it would be cruel to say that ADA does not cover this,

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:23.540
When the ADA, as I said, as a foundation for a sweeping inclusion,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.760
it's beautiful.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.640
I mean, if you only want to read to court orders, I recommend the Blick and the Scribd,

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.060
because those judges really got them.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:37.020
You can search on my search button and you can find links to the actual settlements.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:45.500
Okay, there's one new loss, just two so you don't feel like didn't give you the full story for your pocket there.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.400
Domino's Pizza won their case in Los Angeles.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.300
How many of you have heard about that?

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.680
Yeah, just a couple.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.240
So maybe I shouldn't be telling the rest of you, I don't want to give you negative information, but it's happened.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.720
Domino's Pizza lost their case.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.780
It's on appeal to the Ninth Circuit.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.920
I'm involved with a couple lawyers writing friends of the court briefs for all the cases that go up.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:13.360
We want to make sure that the judges realize this is not just about one lawyer or one person.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:19.820
A lot of national disability rights organizations are filing amicus, we're we want to make us brief together

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.240
on all the cases that go up.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.760
So, I feel really good about that.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.260
Problem in Domino's, the judge didn't get it.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.720
Said, oh, there are no regulations, it's not really fair to have a lawsuit.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:36.140
And so far that's the only case that has said that and to your question, it's in the central district of California,

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:43.200
and ... one of the,  oh, ah ...

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.080
Hobby Lobby might be in the Central District of California too.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.760
So it was the same court district came to a completely different reasoning

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.760
about what does it mean not to have regulations.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:33:00.380
And there's more cases coming and this is just a way to kind of inoculate you as you read them.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:04.640
If you start going on Twitter and following me or Dennis or any people who post this stuff,

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.000
you're gonna hear more about these cases and there's more of them, which

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.780
here's one example.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.980
This is a picture of a University up here, times eight .

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:18.420
Two weeks ago, one lawyer filed eight cases against eight universities in New York City.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:23.140
So you know I'm not gonna give an opinion on what I think about that strategy,

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.760
but it's real and it's there in those cases are out there.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.540
They're probably going to have motions to dismiss it, wins or losses

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:37.080
Oh ... I had one other slide, I didn't put the slide in but I can tell you,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.580
the other slide had a picture of a credit union, times nine.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.860
Because last week ... you know about that?

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:57.280
[Attendee]: [off mic]

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.320
Yeah, we'll see this was the thing, so they, yeah, so in for this

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.020
for the people who are listening you weren't on the mic you said that

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.380
you work for a remediation company and you've remediated hundreds of

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.940
Community Bank

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.400
because of the demand letters.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.880
Well, now there's been nine cases, nine filed in Virginia in one week.

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:18.380
So that's brand new and that's out there.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.740
And ... it's a roller coaster.

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.680
And here's my picture of the roller coaster

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.040
and I think it's really important because

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:30.000
there'd be a lot of attention ... like I can guarantee you the next time

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.680
there is a company or a school or government agency who wins,

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.600
you're gonna see a lot written, oh my god, web accessibility isn't required.

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.840
This is considered this year booster shot against that.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.940
So you have in your pocket knowing, hey there are lawsuits all over the country.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.560
That doesn't change the foundation, doesn't change the foundation cases.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.860
The big picture one, like I said, some courts say you need connection to a physical place.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.840
Other courts say you don't and big picture to is don't be distracted by the court losses.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.460
I really believe in that. I have to tell myself that.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.700
Because you know I've been doing this for, like I said, 17 years,

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:09.160
and it breaks my heart when ever see one court loss

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.240
or whenever I see a lawsuit I think it's frivolous or whatever I think a lawyer was overreaching

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.780
I'm like, oh my god, this is so important to people, it shouldn't even be in the law.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:23.380
And the law could temporarily screw it up if we lose sight of the big picture.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:29.580
So I think the big picture is like this rolling ... I have a picture of a highway with the you know ups and downs.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.020
But I think all legal roads lead to access.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:36.400
And here's my slide for my line of spend money on access not lawyers.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.400
I mean that really has to be the message.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.980
Strategy number two, that people have used government agency activity.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:47.760
The US Department of Justice was long a champion on digital accessibility.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.780
They have a web page, those cases are still good, the Department of Justice still set it.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:36:01.240
It's ADA dot gov forward slash access dot tech, I think, that's it, or tech dot access.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.440
You can see back 12 years, I think.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.920
The US Department of Justice did settlements.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.980
Of course, they're not doing them any more,

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.480
but that web page is still up.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.140
So, fingers crossed.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.800
The big activity here on government agencies

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.500
that's happening right now is

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.780
the Department of Education ...

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.480
have any of you been affected by

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.700
complaints by Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights?

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.160
Just one person.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.460
Well, my slide here says, 1700 and counting.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.840
Department of Ed complaints about web access.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.240
I swear to you, I learned yesterday there's more than 2,500.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.100
And they're all being filed by one person.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:44.260
The vast majority being filed by one person out of Michigan, who's basically doing it on a volunteer basis.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:50.080
The picture I have here is of a barrage, which I had to look up, because there was a headline and a head deck

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.780
type of journal, that said barrage of complaints being filed.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.220
A barrage is like a military thing.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.400
I guess you guys know. I didn't know.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.120
So there's a lot of settlements.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.200
The Department of Ed is still investigating these.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.060
You can go to the Department of Education website

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.180
under Office of Civil Rights and you can read them all.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:14.440
They have, they're called resolution letters, or resolution settlements.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:18.080
You can read the letters that the Department of Ed writes to the higher ed,

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:23.440
and you can read the settlements, as a results, which we're gonna talk about what those include in a minute.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.180
So, of course, strategy three, as you now know my favorite strategy is structured negotiation.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.340
And like I said it's been really effective with banks.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:39.300
I just put a few logos from some of the companies we've worked with.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.360
H-E-B is a grocery store in Texas.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.360
Do I have any Riverland in Texas?

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.140
Here's an example of structured negotiation.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.320
We worked on talking prescription labels with them.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:55.120
And because, the very first meeting, the pharmacy people got to meet the blind clients.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.240
Again, all accessible tech is about people.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:03.160
And once you meet a blind person who has prescriptions and can't read the label,

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:09.860
it's yeah, it's a lot harder than if you hire a lawyer to read a legal brief that says

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.600
well, the ADA doesn't mention talking prescription labels.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.400
That's true, it doesn't mention talking prescription labels.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.120
But, it does talk about inclusion and effective communication.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.620
So H-E-B was just one of many.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:28.080
We've worked with CVS and Walgreens, Rite Aid, Caremark to work on the talking prescription label.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:32.360
Major League Baseball, another great example of structured negotiation.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.980
I talk a lot about the story of Major League Baseball in the book.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:39.280
But just really quick to you guys is that blind baseball fans,

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.780
well, first of all, blind people, like sighted people like baseball.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.920
And a lot of baseball is online.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.660
How many people know that baseball is like big thing online?

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:55.000
Oh you're on the ... well you have the Chicago Cubs, right now ... yeah.

00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:02.520
So the blind fans started in Boston, Red Sox fans had tried to work with Major League Baseball

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:11.740
with ... are you from Boston? Ah, from Worcester. Oh yes, yes, don't hold it against her.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.980
So they had tried to work with Major League Baseball and another good thing about structured negotiation,

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.640
it's a way to open a door.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:22.020
And when you file a lawsuit, it's also a way to open a door, kind of like with a steamroller

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.640
way to break down the door.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:27.740
But we were able to write to Major League Baseball and say hey you have a problem here,

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.260
with your website and here a blind baseball fans, let's see if we can work it out.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.080
It's a legal violation. We have a strong foundation, you know,

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.200
structured negotiation doesn't shy away from referencing the foundation,

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.340
kind of like how I'm doing here, which hopefully is not giving you a sense of fear,

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:48.840
but a sense of, wow, we have a country with good laws that protect disabled people.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.400
We sat down with Major League Baseball over the phone,

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.940
because we're all in different places.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:40:01.000
I'm in California, they're based in New York, and the blind fans and the people like you and Major League Baseball,

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.360
they just hit it off.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.640
And I was ... and Linda Dardarian, who also did this work with me, another lawyer,

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:12.420
we were really in the back seat and it could really be about people it was very successful.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.300
They became a real champion.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:23.240
I think they use their services, they help other entertainment, they have a very big tech department.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.020
They worked on their mobile app, they were really a great partner.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.020
We work with Anthem. I don't know, are any of you guys in health care?

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.360
I mean health care, that ... should put that on your list Dennis for outreach.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:41.180
Because, health care, what ... when you talk about ... I mean another piece of accessibility is privacy.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.780
And one of the things I always try to say when I speak to companies,

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:51.460
like you wouldn't let somebody put content on your website that created a privacy breach

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.780
or a security breach.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:58.980
But if you don't have accessible pages, disabled people have to get help from family members

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:04.960
or strangers or whomever, to get basic private information, like what's on their health records

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.220
or, you know, what's on their financial records.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:14.160
So I think it's really important that we use the privacy and security and health as a piece of the accessibility

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:20.380
to remind people, yeah, without accessibility, you know, if your thing doesn't have keyboard access,

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:25.180
you could have a veteran and can't use a mouse and he you know doesn't get the information.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.380
So Anthem was a great partner of ours.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.760
More structured negotiation win-wins.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.380
Lyft worked in structured negotiation,

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.780
not with me with other lawyers

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.160
on their ride sharing service.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.140
The Motley Fool was a great partner,

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.460
ETrade really good partner.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.460
And just a shout out and ETrade,

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:47.660
big company, worked with them on their trading platform, as I did also with Schwab,

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.260
and accessibility is about people on the side of the disabled people,

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.040
but it's also about people like you.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:00.680
And at ETrade, there's like one woman there who is driving this entire accessibility initiative.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.680
and she's a paralegal in the legal office.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.880
So I usually say, oh keep accessibility out of a law office.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.600
I might have even said that here today.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:15.260
But, I have to put a footnote to that, to say, you know, she became a champion of this and, you know,

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.260
that's a very big company she was working with.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:22.640
So ETrade, Charles Schwab was another trading company I work with that was really effective.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:29.300
Again, because we had the blind trader come into the office and meet the developers and meet the trainers

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.940
and their jaws are dropping.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.280
They had never seen a blind person use their site.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.860
This woman has JAWS on her computer plus a Braille display

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:42.760
and there was one point in her demonstration, you know, she was showing them

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.220
and she was like a no-nonsense person,

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.080
and she got something, she goes, like, I don't know what this is, like,

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.600
this is really easy, you can fix this by labeling the button.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:54.700
And the developer said, it's the Help button and I don't think you need it.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:43:00.460
You know, they were just so impressed, not that they should be impressed that someone can use their site,

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:05.900
but, I really can't stress enough the importance to bringing people with disabilities into meet,

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:12.380
there's a great, it's unrelated, there's a great blog post at the DropBox accessibility people wrote

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:16.500
that I really recommend to you, how to create enthusiasm and excitement about ...

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.100
you can just look up DropBox accessibility culture,

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.240
and they do things, like have awards and badges and things like that.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:30.960
So laws, we have the foundation we have the advocates we have a strategy and we have the results.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.700
And this is results for these same people we talked about before.

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:40.580
We're gonna skip through that and talk about good strategies make access stick.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:45.320
So there are basically a list the best practices that have come out of the legal space

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:47.880
and they have also come out of the non-legal space.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:52.760
Many companies do this without waiting for structured negotiation or a lawsuit.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:58.320
But there are best practices that you can use in your pocket to say, you know,

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:03.700
many legal settlements have required this and now that we're getting judges to say more about accessibility,

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:07.460
sometimes judges are saying stuff about these things too.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.980
So the best practice list, first of all,

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:14.020
I think you guys all know this, that whatever aspect of tech you're working on,

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.220
has to be part of your accessibility plan.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:22.320
Web, mobile, learning systems, library systems, trading platforms,

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:26.320
kiosks is starting to be more litigation on kiosks.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.800
It was just a recent settlement against the eatsa restaurant chain.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.140
Do you have that in Chicago?

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.580
Do I know ... how many of you have heard of that?

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.800
It seems like a few have.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.760
It's a restaurant where they try not to have any workers, it's really kind of sad,

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:47.480
and it's just a tablet that you order your food and you pay your bill and

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.640
someone wasn't thinking about people.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.900
They weren't thinking about all their people when they put in that system and it wasn't accessible.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:45:00.040
So there was just a good settlement after a ... I don't remember what the lawsuit was filed.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.180
I think it might have been.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.140
But it's settled right away there weren't any court...

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.900
I mean structured negotiation is when you don't even have to do a lawsuit.

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:11.640
A lot of times people file a lawsuit but then they kind of go in and negotiation,

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:16.620
which you can call structured negotiation or not structured or just regular negotiation.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:23.360
So the eatsa chain agreed that all the kiosks are going to be accessible to everybody.

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:28.380
So if you have have kiosks, the best practice line is do it right at the beginning.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.500
Do an audit of everything, even if you have separate teams,

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:36.080
which, you know, many companies I work with the web team is different than the mobile team.

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.820
Sometimes the twain never meets,

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.420
and you could have a great web ...

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.480
website people have heard of website accessibility a little more than they've heard of mobile accessibility,

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.760
which is so silly because we're migrating away ...

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:54.100
this is another problem with law, is that law is like slow like a turtle

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.200
and technology at its best is fast and creative.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.040
And law looks back.

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.460
What's the precedent on this? You know, what happened in the past?

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:07.120
Whereas, you guys are the creative people. You want to look forward.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.480
So, the more you can do before the law hits your company,

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.180
the better, because then you lose some element of control.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.880
The standard, like I said, is WCAG 2.0 AA.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.320
All the settlement's use it, the Justice Department used it when they were doing this work,

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.960
all the Department of Ed settlements use it.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:33.100
As I said, it's in the 508, it's not specifically in ADA, but there's no question that it's a good standard

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:36.260
and it is the standard that everybody should be working on.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:40.080
You know, we are ... there is a WCAG 2.1 out there.

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:42.940
WCAG 2.1 is that it's ...

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:47.980
and Dennis knows more about this than I do, but it's not gonna mean all your work on 2.0 AA is no good.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:51.300
No, it's still going to be good. There's going to be new things that you can do,

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:57.780
the law will catch up to that, but it will be ... the site's will be better if you can use 2.1 when it comes out,

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:03.440
but WCAG 2.0 AA right now is the policy and around the world too.

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.860
And all that internet when you're ...

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:09.240
don't forget of yourselves as part of an international champion network.

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:14.640
Have a web accessibility coordinator decide where the person is and make sure

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.220
the person is in kind of a neutral place.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.820
I know every place has politics.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:23.240
You want to make sure the web access ... and it should be called the accessibility coordinator,

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.160
not the web access, I'm sorry, I want to change that.

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:29.400
Just to get away from this idea that it's only about web,

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:36.460
the buck has to stop somewhere and it needs to stop in a place that's respected throughout the organization.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:44.000
I mean, hats off to Microsoft for having Jenny Lay-Flurrie in a position called Chief Accessibility Officer

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.880
in the C-suite and, she's amazing.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.480
I mean, that's another thing, if you don't know her and you don't know the work Microsoft's doing,

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:57.800
I really recommend it to you, she's a great person to follow on Twitter and she does a lot of great blog posts.

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:04.280
And Microsoft's ... another thing, Microsoft's new CEO has two disabled children, one of who's in adult.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.520
and that is really making a difference.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:11.680
And to the company, in the combination of him whose name forgetting right now and Jenny,

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:16.680
is just really a good example of companies that are putting the best practices into place.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.660
You know, they're not waiting for a lawsuit to come knocking.

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.460
Use an independent consultant when you need one.

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:27.900
But it's really important to treat anything you do with accessibility the same the same ...

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.640
... the same way you treat anything else.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.340
Too often, I see companies, they just panic, they run out, they get the first consultant that they,

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.520
you know, there's a lot and just like there's a lot of new plaintiffs lawyers, there's a lot of new defense lawyers

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:42.400
and there's a lot of new consultants.

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:44.060
And you really need to be careful.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.400
I tell everyone, talk to at least two or three people, get references,

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.160
treat it like you would any other vendor.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.160
Somehow, people think accessibility is ...

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.680
oh, we don't have to worry about it in the same way.

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.540
And, no, that's not true.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.720
We did a deal with American Express early on to have Braille and large print statements.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.260
And they promised that they would have a statements delivered to blind people in a reasonable time.

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.820
Well, it would be one month, even two months before the statement came,

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:16.340
because they were doing this one-off thing with some small vendor and finally, they didn't like it either,

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.800
finally we agreed, they're gonna systematize the process.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:26.240
This was back in the early 2000s and hire a vendor, the same way they'd hire a vendor for anything else.

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:31.100
You know, vet it and make sure the person or the company is you know good and responsible

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.420
and get references and have good vendor contracts.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:37.660
So, it's really important, if you're going to use a consultant, if you don't have the in-house help

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.660
to make sure whoever you get is good.

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.920
Staff training is critical.

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:42.660
I think Dennis ...

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.080
many, some of you may have heard me say

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.100
I could do a whole presentation, just say train all staff.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.760
I mean in terms of putting something in your pocket almost every case

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:58.440
starts, in structured negotiation, when somebody calls the legitimate cases

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:04.080
somebody calls up and says, I can't do this and they don't get the right answer.

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:09.160
You've got to have a program where whoever's answering the phone or answering the email

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.820
understands that people with disabilities use technology.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:17.640
And if that means having a company-wide program and bringing people in, whatever it takes.

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:21.760
Still to this day, I'm sure Kelly and other blind people in the room can attest

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:26.780
that you call up and someone will say, don't you have someone who can help you with this?

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:28.760
Does that still happen?

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:35.760
Yeah. I mean we did a case and the woman called up and they said can't your mother read that to you?

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:39.820
She says, I'm 45, my mother is dead. Like what are you talking about?

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:46.120
But this still happens, because the training isn't good and training again like anything else,

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:52.360
make sure you have good people, ideally at least one person with a disability doing the training early on.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:57.820
When I did architectural access cases, we did stadium work and we'd have a person a blind person,

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:01.380
a person a wheelchair go and talk to the teams, made all the difference.

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:05.580
Because too many people don't know and that's why structured negotiation again,

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.780
If accessibility is people centered,

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:14.520
then people with disabilities have to be worked into your usability testing, and all your other programs.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.100
Adding it to performance evaluations.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.260
If it's someone's job to make something accessible,

00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.020
now you should be evaluated on that,

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.440
so they can get improvement when they fall short.

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:27.820
Post a policy, have a homepage accessibility information page.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.420
I'm a big believer in this.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:34.000
Have any of you been in a situation where you wanted to put something on your website

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.720
and someone from a different department said no we don't want to say anything about it.

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.340
Have any of you guys ... yeah ...

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:45.420
Some lawyer ... this is the thing, lawyers are risk averse, so we better not say anything,

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.180
because then someone will think we're not doing enough.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:52.280
Well, hello, when somebody calls me with a problem, the very first thing I do is look on the website

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.180
and see is there a link to an accessibility page.

00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:00.100
And if there is, there needs to be a good phone number and a good email and a good statement.

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.000
It could be one sentence ...

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:08.520
"We are committed to making our website usable by everyone. If you have a problem, call this number."

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:14.440
I mean, it's bad ... you know I like it when you say more and you say using WCAG, but really,

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:20.000
if you just said that, and on my site I have a popular post section and there's a link ...

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:24.100
I gather up accessibility information pages from all over the web,

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.780
so I have about 50 on there, you could take a look at them.

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:30.300
Use a testing tool, do usability testing.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.920
Really be specific in your vendor contracts.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.540
I mean, people always like my website.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.440
I you know someone today said to me,

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.180
"oh, your website's really easy to find things."

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:40.760
You know, person without a disability.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.100
I said yeah that's what accessibility is.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.020
And that wasn't coincidental.

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:49.840
I mean I have an amazing Wordpress developer named Nathalie McLeese from Pasadena,

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:54.900
who has Purple Pen Productions is her company, and she's committed to accessibility.

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:59.840
I'm committed to accessibility, but we still we had a ... she was my vendor so we had a contract.

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.820
And we said, what the standard was and, you know,

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:06.120
we said there was going to be testing three different times for my little website,

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.420
by a cross-section of people.

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.560
So higher education settlements are pretty much the same.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.360
They have the elements that I just mentioned

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.360
with the other settlements of best practices.

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:20.440
In higher-ed technology, audit required, web and apps,

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:24.580
we haven't talked too much about video, but video accessibility is huge.

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.880
There's a lot of like that Netflix streaming case was captioning,

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:32.920
a lot of education learning is happening by video now, has to be captioned.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:36.660
There's a lot on that, library systems, course materials,

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.860
training is all in the higher ed settlements that you can read online,

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.420
and having an accessibility tech coordinator in the IT department.

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:53.640
One thing about the higher ed settlements that are happening now ... getting my five minutes, okay,

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.540
you know if you end up in a legal problem with the government,

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:01.540
like the opposite Civil Rights Department of Ed and they're going to be looking over your shoulder.

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:07.560
And one reason structured negotiations has been so great is that

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.060
nobody wants anybody looking over their shoulders.

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:13.780
Blind people don't want it, companies don't want it, the government's don't want it,

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:20.520
we all know best on how to do this that fits with our corporate culture and the needs of disabled people.

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:26.220
So really, the message is, this law is in your pocket to tell your companies, let's not wait,

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.500
let's not wait until we get the knock on the door.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:37.700
So if you want more law, they are higher ed updates at bit.ly forward slash HigherEda11y.

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:42.600
That's maintained by someone at University of Minnesota, she does a great job with all the higher ed.

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:50.120
You can sign up on my contact page for my email list, where I send out updates, very infrequently, but I do.

00:54:51.440 --> 00:55:00.180
There's a blog by a defense firm that's called www.adatitleiii.com.

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.680
That's where I rely on getting ... they do a very good job on the metrics.

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:10.020
This is where I learned that there's 750 pending federal cases as of August on websites.

00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:13.880
750 ... last year there were like 250.

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:18.000
I have my book for sale, I sell it basically a cost, which is thirty dollars,

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.920
which is cheaper, way cheaper than Amazon or the ABA.

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:29.820
It has stories, stories about Kelly and other people and has strategies it has accessibility.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:34.680
Whitney gave it a great review and the usability magazine earlier this year,

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:38.180
recommending it for usability people, so I recommend it to you.

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:43.020
I can ... I have them and I can take cash, check or credit card.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.140
And please stay in touch with me.

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:49.660
Think of me as someone, if you have a question, you know, you can find me on Twitter,

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:55.000
you can find me on my contact page, you can send me an email directly at LF@LFlegal.com.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:56:02.360
Take advantage of my website I really do it for you. I really do it for you guys and the disability community.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:07.860
Because the law is really active in this space and I feel we all have a right to put it in our pocket.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.920
So, thank you. Thank you, Dennis. Appreciate you guys.

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:16.020
[Applause]

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:20.500
[Dennis]:  What we're gong to do, were going to open this up for questions and answers.

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:28.400
Before we get into that, we do have a copy of Lainey's book to give away. we'll do that right after Q&amp;A.

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:33.560
I'm still thinking up the question, so ask lots of questions.

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:38.500
Ok so let me give this to you and please ask away, anyone who has any questions.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.960
[Lainey]: Oh, we're going to wait for the mic, hold on ...

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:57.560
Oops, I thought you were first. You'll be second. Go ahead.

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:11.140
[Attendee]: My question was, I was watching a podcaster webinar talking about the increase in lawsuits

00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.760
[indecipherable]

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:21.660
As a ... I think it was [indecipherable] put together, and I sign up for a couple of their different webinars

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.500
throughout the last year, so it's amazing how much ...

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:29.700
some of that has changed, like from a year ago to now,

00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:30.200
[Lainey]: Yes.

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:34.760
[Attendee]: one thing you didn't touch on is banking during your presentation.

00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:39.420
I wonder if you have any thoughts on that ... in aging population.

00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:48.300
The reason why is in general lawsuits ... [indecipherable] ... digital and ecommerce access

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:53.000
of services and [indecipherable].

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.840
[Lainey]: Yeah, first of all, for those of you who don't know,

00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:00.380
Level Access is one of the consultants in this space, puts a really good information.

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:07.000
I can really recommend them. Also WebAIM that was does a survey they also put out really good information.

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:13.920
I'm hesitant ...

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:20.760
You know if we weren't being live-streamed, I might say something different than I'm about to say.

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:25.260
But now I'm going to say ... hello out there in live stream land!

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:26.660
I meant to say hello earlier.

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.760
There's more lawsuits ... that's really all I can say.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:34.980
I mean ...

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:42.120
it used to be when I did the updates, there'd be like four people I would call around the country and say,

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.240
what's happening?

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:48.920
You know, like, and a few lawyers have done a phenomenal job in the space on higher ed

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.080
and I know all the lawyers doing the voting cases

00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:58.940
and you, know I think what happened is, this became an area that courts and settlements

00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:00.940
so we created that foundation.

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.700
For 15 years, we created that foundation,

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:09.300
and that caused other people with other strategy ideas to come in.

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:13.920
And that's why I said earlier about the toolbox, you know,

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:18.540
there are have been a couple lawyers, one in Arizona, that is subject to disbarment

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:22.060
for not on web cases but on architectural cases.

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:26.120
There are already systems in place to deal with people who may be miss ...

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:30.900
... I'm not saying the Florida lawyers are, I'm not saying any of the web are,

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:34.380
and the thing is, if I asked you, how many of you knew

00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:38.600
that Bank America committed to accessibility through structured negotiation,

00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.600
did any of you know that before tonight?

00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:47.540
Yeah, see, when you mean, yeah blind people no, because but what happens is

00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:56.380
lawsuits get attention and attention gets action, so you are totally right that the senior population needs access

00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.960
and now that there's more attention, that could be one thing driving it.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:04.120
It's also that there's just more legal activity in the space.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.620
And there's more seniors.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:15.020
And that's a good thing for, to have in the pockets not so much a, see seniors ...

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.940
the word seniors don't have a legal right under the ADA,

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:28.180
but the truth is seniors become disabled because they have impairments that affect their lives

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:34.640
and particularly seeing and hearing as well as you know when you have certain neurological things

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:43.780
yeah, so we call it seniors, but really it's a growing disability population, part of its languaging.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.840
[Attendee]: Is it ok if I don't use a mic?

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.180
[Dennis]: We actually need the mic for the stream.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.280
[Lainey]: I know, the mic wasn't that good.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:58.460
[Attendee]: So, two questions, very quickly,

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:04.320
One, if you are developing, so, I'm a front-end developer, we're developing

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.260
and you are on a particular operating system

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:15.840
and you have, you're meeting AA requirements for a particular browser, on a particular device,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
are you done?

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:23.300
Or do you need to ... because that's where we are really struggling, because it's like,

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:28.280
the screen readers don't all behave well, and what's interesting is that,

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:32.380
it doesn't seem there are any ADA regulations about screen readers.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:37.140
There's plenty about what we have to have on websites, so my question is first,

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:44.780
if I secure myself, my site at double A, on Safari, on Mac,

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.220
do I have to worry about Chrome? Do I have to worry about Firefox?

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.500
Because it really can become quite cumbersome.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:02:00.500
[Lainey]: Yeah, I have sympathy for the developers that it is not so easy that there's

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.340
screen readers behave differently on different browsers.

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.340
But, because accessibility is about people

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.140
and people have the right, I mean, the way the ADA works,

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.400
when we did the talking ATM cases ...

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.080
here's why that initiative was successful.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.080
The one that we first did the ATMs we insisted on one talking ATM in every place.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.460
we would meet with them by the month and they would give us charts

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:28.440
showing how many ATMs we never touched by a blind person.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.540
So like what the hell, like we're spending all this money

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:36.160
and we'd be like, well a blind person could be visiting their grandmother next week.

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:40.440
It has to be in every place, because every place where you have ATMs

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:47.260
and one of the Bank America higher up people like a light bulb went off.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.480
And he stood up in front of an ATM convention, he asked me if I would co-present with him and I said yes.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.360
And the convention wouldn't have me.

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:58.900
They didn't want me, even though I have a kinder gentler law practice, I was still ...

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:02.020
And he got up, his name was Bill Raymond, and he got up and he said

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:06.540
this is a civil right of individual people and that's why we're doing it.

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:09.560
Let's stop counting how many people aren't doing it.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:13.500
So I thought of that when I asked your question, because, you know,

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:20.620
most people who are ... most blind people that I know who are using computers, not phones, but computers

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.580
aren't using a Mac with Safari.

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:25.900
They're still using IE on a PC with JAWS.

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:31.480
And, that's why the screenreader test, the survey is so important, because we see

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.000
and yeah it's growing, NVDA is growing more, but it's not enough to say what ...

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.100
I don't think it's enough to say one done, but the courts, you know, they have not gotten this deep in into it.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:48.780
But if it was a case and the IE user on a PC went to court, it wouldn't,

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:52.020
I don't think really help to say somebody else can use it.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:55.300
Because the person who wanted to use it couldn't use it.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.720
So that's a challenge.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.760
[Dennis]:  And let me just chime in there as a front-end web developer.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:12.900
If a screen reader or browser is not following the spec, the WCAG spec from the W3C,

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.360
the guidance is, submit a bug request.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.960
And I can tell you, working for, a screen reader company,

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.180
we're fixing those bugs.

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:36.120
So, if Apple Safari, submit those as pull requests. I know Apple is quite good at responding to those.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.340
So, but I do understand your challenge outside of that.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:45.360
[Attendee]: So, really quick, last question ... [indecipherable] ...

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.880
isn't a screen reader responsible for ... [indecipherable] ...

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.920
because that doesn't ... that I don't understand.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.320
Now if it's ... [indecipherable] ...

01:04:54.800 --> 01:05:00.040
that makes sense to me. And let me just say that I absolutely understand and support closed captioning.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:09.240
But, to me, why would the screen reader be responsible for ... [indecipherable] ... content?

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:14.080
[Lainey]: Ok, that's a good ... why would the distributor be responsible for buc ... produced content.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.080
So there is a ...

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:21.500
don't forget that the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed by a Republican i,t was a bipartisan effort.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.380
It's not just a one-sided thing.

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:28.160
So there's a section in there that says if you are a bookstore you do not have to sell Braille books.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:33.020
Which is kind of what you're saying, like if you're selling books, you don't sell Braille books.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.060
But with the movies, what happens is, you think,

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:43.980
if Netflix had any control, there's another section the ADA and this is why the vendor in the Winn-Dixie case,

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:52.540
the Winn-Dixie judge said it's Winn-Dixie responsibility to have their vendors deliver accessible products,

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.900
because the Americans with Disabilities Act says

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:59.360
you can't discriminate directly or through contracting

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.980
or other means of administration, some legal blah blah.

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:10.840
But the truth is, you're the public entity putting the thing out, so they tried to get that case thrown out.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:16.700
I believe, don't quote me on that, even in webinars they don't quote me on this.

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:21.580
I think they tried to get it thrown out on the Braille book exception that the movies

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:28.320
were like books, but Netflix must have had enough control in the distribution

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:30.700
where captioning could be injected

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:36.380
at the points where they were either in control or had vendor control over to vendors, not the products.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.280
That's what ... I am not an expert on closed captioning.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:47.200
Yeah, I'm not a real expert on that, but the Netflix decision is a really good decision, it probably explains this.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.660
Ok, we have time for a couple more questions.

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.280
[Dennis]: Just a couple more ...

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.940
[Attendee]: So, the structured settlements that you talked about,

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:11.340
that's a pretty impressive list of companies ... referring to.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:18.460
who are the individuals ... what is the persona ... [indecipherable] ... that you're talking about.

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:21.780
[indecipherable]

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.260
Is it always the law department that is handling those sorts of things,

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:32.420
or does it have to come from the CEO ... [indecipherable] ... what is the genesis of something like that?

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.520
How does that, in your experience, how does that even get done?

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.080
[Lainey]: Yeah, that's a good question.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.800
How does it, how does how do we open the door

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:43.060
and who do, whose door do we open?

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.600
And we always write to the top lawyer.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:52.160
Because we're lawyers and there's sort of a legal ethics thing that lawyers aren't supposed to talk to

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:56.000
the people in a company

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.500
about legal claims.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.080
They're supposed to go through their lawyers.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.840
So we always go through the top lawyers.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:05.720
What that top lawyer does often it has to go to the very top.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.740
And that eTrade thing, that the paralegal just as an example, has been a great champion,

01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:14.300
because she rounded up all the  people.

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:19.500
I mean, basically, what my role is, to say you need to get this done, who needs to be at the table?

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.860
And I think it's really important not to take a cookie cutter approach to this,

01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.660
because every company is different.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.740
Every company has a corporate culture.

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:35.440
And the book by Jeff Kline about ... it's k-l-i-n-e, it's a good book,

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:38.860
he talks about where to put the accessibility coordinator

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.720
to have the most influence in the company.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.720
Or look at Microsoft, the difference it's made to have a have a CEO.

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:50.080
But oftentimes, it's a whole panoply of people

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.140
and some other companies they've been so small,

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:56.880
there's just been like the Chief Information Officer has dealt with it.

01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:01.720
So it isn't that really a one-size-fits-all answer, but the good thing about structured negotiation

01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:06.760
is we're able to say to the lawyer, you have a problem, and then the lawyer can round up the people

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.520
who may be people like you and not just assign it to an associate to write a legal brief

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.520
that the ADA doesn't cover it.

01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:18.660
That's what I like best about it that we don't have to be arguing about legal theories,

01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:20.300
instead we're talking about fixes.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.720
[Dennis]: Last question.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.120
[Lainey]: Whoops, we have two last questions.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.640
Ok, two last questions ... make them quick.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.540
[Attendee]: Any good wins for video description, in higher ed?

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.540
[Lainey]: There haven't been any wins or losses on video description in higher ed.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:51.060
Many of the vendors that do the captioning also do the video description.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.460
And so I think some of that's being incorporated.

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:57.460
And there's been a good settlement, Netflix did a subsequent settlement

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:06.780
on video description and now you can look up Netflix videos and see which ones have have video description.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.120
Ok, last question.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:18.440
[Attendee]: Hi, I guess my question was, does the law treat a website that anyone can access

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:25.060
differently than a website that you have to sign in to? Or even a website that is members only?

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:31.640
Like you can't just sign up and log in, or are they all treated equal, as far as accessibility?

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:37.020
[Lainey]: They are treated equal to the extent that the ...

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.180
the owner of the website is a public accommodation.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:46.940
So it has ... like if it was a website, it was an employment website,

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.260
the rules for employment are slightly different.

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:53.320
In employment, you have to accommodate individual employees.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.800
So if you had a blind employee, you would have to accommodate them.

01:10:56.140 --> 01:11:00.940
Whereas with, if you're like all these financial, you have to log on to.

01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:02.180
So ...

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:06.020
whether or not you have to log on that has nothing to do with it.

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.940
If you're ... it's basically, again, what's in your pocket?

01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:14.960
If you're offering to the public, whether the pay, like we did, The Motley Fool,

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:18.240
things started with people who had paid memberships with Motley Fool

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.700
and they weren't getting the information they were paying for.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:26.320
Sometimes, people aren't getting the information that's free, so ... yeah ... Thank you.

# Where Does User Experience & Accessibility Meet?
## Richard Douglass - Thursday, October 27, 2016
[Source recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OGvMXS7fcM)

**[Richard]:** Thank you so much for inviting me here and for giving me some of your time. A little bit about me. I've been involved in the user-experience field for a little over 16 years or so. I spent time on big companies internal teams like Dennis just mentioned.

5
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:45,200
About the last 4 or 5 years, I've been doing independent work, freelancing contract work as well.

6
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,520
Worked at a number of different settings, number of different companies.

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,800
And I had an opportunity to work in all the different kinds of verticals with all different kinds of situations.

8
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,340
When I'm not doing user-experience work, you'll find me outdoors.

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,880
That's me and my oldest son.

10
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:11,460
We've got to spend 5 days on the Appalachian trails couple of years ago in Tennessee, North Carolina area.

11
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,400
We're on top of Big Bald Mountain there, which is a pretty cool place.

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,660
On the clear day, you can see most of the southern Appalachian mountain range, which is pretty cool.

13
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:30,100
If I'm not doing this, I'm on a canoe or tent, or some sort of place like that out with my kids.

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,080
So, with user-experience work, I find myself in a number of different settings.

15
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,600
Up at the top there, I do a lot of strategy work.

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,360
I do a lot of work with helping companies create user personas and customer journey maps.

17
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,940
Relating this to, not only their business, but their user trying to connect those together

18
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,900
so we can craft effective solutions together.

19
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,560
And then I also do a lot of wireframing work, interaction design as well.

20
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,640
And I also do quite a bit of user research.  That's me on the far right

21
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:16,560
at a project recently where I was helping to design a concept for helping rail workers

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,020
that are working on a railroad line be safe.

23
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,120
So it was iPad based, so if you're on the network...

24
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,900
My co-workers were jealous.

25
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:35,040
I got to spend the entire day riding a train next to an engineer wearing my high vis vest, of course.

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,440
I got to spend the second day out with the work crew, with the foreman,

27
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,840
checking out the lines and the crews and the flags they were using.

28
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,100
But the kind of work that we do in user-experience,

29
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,480
it takes you to a lot of different places and makes it kind of fun.

30
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,240
But what I want to talk about tonight is not just user-experience, but accessibility.

31
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,800
And what I keep finding, really, probably less or 10 years or so,

32
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,180
accessibility keeps coming up, it keeps becoming a part of what I do.

33
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:16,040
I was telling someone earlier tonight, I've been through couple of these wars, if you will, or battles where

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,200
a company is under threat of litigation. And they now realize we now have to do something about this.

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,320
And I'm learning the jargon and learning how this all goes, and so it's a little bit about what I want to share.

36
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,920
And, so, why accessibility is important?

37
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,960
All sorts of companies are finding themselves under litigation.

38
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,080
I'm just going to cite one recent example.

39
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:48,920
Peapod settled with the Department of Justice around A.D.A. violations

40
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:57,320
which were essentially, they were found in violation of not providing accessibility for people with disabilities.

41
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,520
I'm not going to read the entire settlement agreement to you here tonight.

42
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,900
Some things I want to highlight though,

43
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,140
they were required to make their sites and their apps conform to WCAG 2.0 AA compliance.

44
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,620
And they were also required any third-party that was providing service to them,

45
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,320
they also had to be WCAG 2.0 as well.

46
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,140
And solicit any feedback from their customers that had disabilities.

47
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,160
They had to contract and perform third-party evaluation and consultation.

48
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,500
They need to do perform regular automated performance testing.

49
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,500
They needed to train other staffs, including new hires on accessibility.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,420
And any issues that were identified, they had to fix them within 30 days.

51
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,800
So, from my experience, this is fairly standard.

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,780
It's pretty par for the course when a company is approached about accessibility issues.

53
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,820
What they're required to do is very similar to this type of scenario.

54
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,140
And I just have couple of companies here that have been cited over the last 15 years or so.

55
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,900
And it's a very long list.

56
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,160
Oftentimes, it's an organization that really just wants the company to fix what's wrong.

57
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,500
They're really not interested in money.

58
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,800
They just want to know that you're going to take care of it.

59
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,080
There are groups that do want money.  And there are not profiting from this.

60
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,940
Unfortunately, Target was one of the best known company that decided to fight.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,580
Their citation for being inaccessible and it really gave them a black eye.

62
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,920
It was all over the news and New York Times and, so, on and so forth.

63
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,800
And they had to settle.  It didn't go over really well for them.

64
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:56,280
So, out of all this, some companies that I've worked for, I started to learn some of the jargon and lingo.

65
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,620
Those of you who are with Dennis's accessibility meetup here, I'm just going to bore you for a second.

66
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:09,300
Forgive me, everybody else in the room.  Some of these acronyms and terms are really important.

67
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,940
The Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990.

68
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,740
And that really, from my point of view,

69
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:26,100
that's sort of like the bedrock of how we dealt with accessibility issues and technology ever since then.

70
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:33,180
And essentially, guarantees people with disabilities equal access.

71
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,280
Section 508, kind of built upon that in the late '90s.

72
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,480
It was another piece of legislation written by Congress that defined, in particular,

73
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,380
around technology and accessibility as well.

74
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:53,580
And WCAG is a series of guidelines.  It's a web content accessibility guidelines.

75
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,820
That's sort of the watermark that everyone needs to hit.

76
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,900
And, so, anybody that does consulting in this area, WCAG is where they always point to

77
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,360
and the guidelines were revised recently few years ago and now we're up to WCAG 2.0.

78
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,240
And there's couple of grades they give out. Single A, double A, and AAA.

79
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,840
Most folks wants you to aim for double A.

80
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:27,720
Triple A is almost impossible to meet.  But double A is what people are held up to.

81
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,420
So, with all of this going on, how are we supposed to respond to this?

82
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:45,400
Well, with the clients that I've work with, I've noticed a few patterns in terms of typical engagement.

83
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,900
There are software programs that will scan your code

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,240
and will highlight areas where your code is in clear violation.

85
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,320
For example, not having an ALT tag for an image.

86
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,620
Not having field labels called out.

87
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:08,040
So on and so forth.  That's usually sort of the ground level, to make sure that's done.

88
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Second thing that's typically done is a human evaluation.

89
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,700
It's also a referred to as accessibility audit.

90
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,460
That's usually done by someone that has a development background.

91
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,400
Is pretty well-versed in accessibility in this WCAG standard

92
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:29,300
and they try to draw a line between where your code exists and where you're in violation.

93
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,800
A lot of times, they will use screen reading software.

94
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,900
The picture there is someone using JAWS

95
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,760
which is the one of the popular software packages that people who are blind use.

96
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,980
I find in many cases, the person doing the human evaluation is sighted.

97
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:55,260
So they're not exactly seeing it or hearing it, if you will, from a blind person's perspective.

98
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,400
But typically, this is done as just sort of table stakes.

99
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,700
And it moves on from there as prioritization exercise and what's going to be tackled.

100
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,660
When I have been part of these evaluations, we typical have had people doing the human evaluations

101
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,280
deliver something like this, it's a spreadsheet.

102
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,280
And it will call out particular issues, by standard, what the description of the issue is,

103
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,340
what the requirement is and how to mitigate against that.

104
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,840
And so that becomes a conversation that's had between the consultant doing human evaluation

105
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,780
and the IT architects and the developers about what can be done, when it can be done,

106
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,780
in light of everything else that's going on inside of the IT Department.

107
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,640
So, for me, I guess, when I've been involved in these kinds of projects,

108
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,500
where we're trying to, in many cases, in a panic, because we have a letter that's been sent out.

109
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,100
Just a little bit of oh, my gosh, we're under the threat of litigation and we need to get this going.

110
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,760
So the question comes up, "is that all we can do?"

111
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,920
And I'm sure for a lot of folks that I worked with on the client side, they're happy just to be compliant.

112
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:24,340
So let's ... let's stop the bad news.  Let's get out of trouble.  I can tell the higher-ups its good, we're cool.

113
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:35,140
So what I've been a part of is conducting usability testing with people who have disabilities.

114
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:43,920
So as an extra step on top of what I just described, you actually bring people in that have various disabilities.

115
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,340
You have them use their hardware, you have them use their software,

116
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,720
and actually step through the application.

117
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,820
Whether it's on the web, whether it's on the mobile device, or whatever it might be.

118
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,860
And from that, there's a great deal of value for that.

119
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,300
To give you an example, this is one I worked on not too long ago.

120
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:18,400
It's supposed to find a financial services advisor from the homepage.

121
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:27,740
This woman that I had here in my usability lab, she actually taught JAWS at a state school for the blind.

122
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,800
And she was an expert, okay?

123
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,220
So she's on the homepage of our website here.  And she types in her zip code.

124
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,240
She gets ... this is just part of the page that's returned to her

125
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:48,560
and so the map there on the left is read as an image, but an image that's not labeled properly.

126
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,440
So she's inferring it's a map.

127
00:11:52,040 --> 00:12:01,340
So a code scan would have said, hey, right there.  Make that empty image tag, fill that out and make it a map.

128
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,820
And you might feel you've taken care of the matter.

129
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,400
On the right, it's an invitation to narrow your research to make get better results.

130
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:17,080
So the way she was reading it with JAWs was empty image, which was probably the map,

131
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,660
and then an invitation to narrow her search.

132
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:26,760
So she automatically blamed herself.  I must have fat fingered my zip code.

133
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,280
So she went ahead and took that invitation to retype her zip code, and try again.

134
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,620
When in actuality, this table is nested right underneath the map.

135
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,160
And there were three folks that were financial service representatives

136
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,340
that were within three miles of her zip code.

137
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,660
So, the reason why I bring this up is, if you had done a code scan,

138
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,800
like I said, it would have caught the fact that there was an empty image tag for the map.

139
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,640
If you had done a human evaluation with a sighted person, they might have missed this.

140
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,400
A good person doing that would have caught it.

141
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,160
In many cases, I call them interaction design problems or layout problems.

142
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,240
It can only be uncovered by bringing people in and they're actually using the technology.

143
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,500
And I found that over and over again to be the case.

144
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:29,220
It's just a tremendous amount of value in adding in that extra layer of bringing in those sorts of folks

145
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,220
to run these types of studies with.

146
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:38,020
So, if I peeked your interest in this, and said, hey, maybe that Richard guy is on to something?

147
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,180
Maybe I might want to try that?

148
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,220
Well, let's talk a little bit about logistics.

149
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,360
Because there's a little bit to think about before you start doing this kind of thing.

150
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:56,320
First of all, are you going to do this testing at someone's house?  Or where they work?

151
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
There's advantages and disadvantages to that.

152
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,440
Obviously, if you're going to work with people with disabilities in their natural environment,

153
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,460
from an ethnographic point of view, that's a real win, right?

154
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:15,440
You're in their natural environment.  They're using their own technology.  You're in their element which is great.

155
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,440
Some of the challenges involved with that is

156
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,740
you're going to have to do a lot of driving around or getting from place to place.

157
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,100
I find typically when I'm doing ethnographic research,

158
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,860
it gets a little bit on the creepy side if there's more than two of us.

159
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,220
It gets a little bit on the Spanish inquisition side of things when there's three or more of us

160
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,740
in someone's cubical or someone's home.

161
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,160
Like who are all these people?

162
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,940
So you're limited in how many people can tag along.

163
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
You're also limited in terms of recording.

164
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,980
A lot of folks aren't really interested in having you install software on their computers

165
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,820
so you can record your screen activities.

166
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,400
So you're somewhat limited to video at that point.

167
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,500
Which isn't a major obstacle.  But it's something to consider.

168
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,560
And also liability is a concern as well.

169
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,080
Some companies just won't let you do that.  Because you're crossing the line.

170
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,460
You're now getting into someone else's house. Insurance.

171
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:20,700
What happens if the dog bites you?  You trip over their couch or...

172
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,900
Sometimes it's just a non-starter.

173
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,180
Another possibility is to test in a formal lab setting, a usability lab of some sort,

174
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,180
whether that's in your building or rented facility.

175
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,840
There's advantages and disadvantages there.

176
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,720
Advantages, you're providing the hardware and software so you have a lot more control over it

177
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:52,660
and you're able to set up the recording a little bit easier that in case.  So that's a win.

178
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,560
Some of these labs I worked in, there's mirrored glass.

179
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:05,020
So you can have a whole host of people observing and the participant isn't mindful of that which is great

180
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,020
to have as many people as possible checking these out as they're going on.

181
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:17,400
Some of the negatives are getting the person to your facility.

182
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,920
Now, if you're on public transportation line, that's great.

183
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,680
If you're, depending on where you're situated, it could be better in one case or the other.

184
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,860
So, for those of you that have done user-experience work, if you've been part of a usability test,

185
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,320
the question can come up how is this different from a typical usability test

186
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,720
when you're running a usability with sighted people with certain application.

187
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:55,400
I have found through experience, you really have to reduce your expectations drastically

188
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
in terms of what you're going to be able to cover.

189
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,260
Most often, you have a much smaller scope.

190
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,000
You're only going to be able to get through a few tasks.

191
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,160
And it's a much slower pace.  It's much more conversational.

192
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:17,280
And depending on how buggy or inaccessible your software is, it could take quite awhile.

193
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:24,140
So, what I've found is when I recruit 5 or 6 people for a day and I have 10 tasks to cover,

194
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,500
I might have to split those tasks up amongst maybe two people at a time.

195
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
I only get to do those particular tasks.

196
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,960
Which I know violates every usability paradigm out there

197
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,140
to only run couple of task with two people.

198
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,260
But you do start seeing the same thing over and over again very quickly.

199
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,640
Moving from A to B.  So getting the person around.

200
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,420
I've learned from having work with people in this community who are very,

201
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,700
for the most part, very sweet and very forgiving of my mistakes.

202
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,740
there's sort of a protocol that you have to develop.

203
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,900
So, if you're going to meet the person, for example, out in from of your office, and they're blind,

204
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,820
you offer your elbow, and say "would you like me to take you where we're going?"

205
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,620
Please grab my elbow. And they'll grab the back of your elbow.

206
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,100
And as you are walking, you have to describe where you are going.

207
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,440
Say, "we're going to go about twenty feet, we're going to take a hard right, And I am going to open a door."

208
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,280
So you are just describing the territory in front of them and what you're doing.

209
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,420
So, you're not grabbing their hand, you're offering your elbow, and you're guiding them.

210
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
That usually works out really well.

211
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,280
You do want to make sure the doors of your building are wide enough to handle a wheelchair if you need to.

212
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
Find out ahead if time,

213
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,320
There are service animals that are involved.

214
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,520
If you're like me, and you're allergic to dogs, that can become an issue.

215
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,380
For me, if I just load up on medication, I'm good. I can make it through.

216
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,540
I have had a service dog put his nose on my lap for tests.

217
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,340
Which was a little weird, but we got through it.

218
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,400
There is also another protocol on how you deal with the animal.

219
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:21,440
You're really not supposed to scratch them between the ears and pet them like a regular dog.

220
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,860
That's a work animal and they're specifically trained to serve the person they're assigned to

221
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,520
and when you interact with them that way, you're pulling them out of that mode, if you will.

222
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,380
So you have to kind of keep your distance on the service animals.

223
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,540
Even though a lot of times, they're really awesome dogs and they're doing really amazing things.

224
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
So just a few other things to consider.

225
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,120
Also, if you have a facility in your building, it's best to clear the tenant thing

226
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,420
with your security people or what not.

227
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,840
Hey, there's at least half dozen people coming throughout the day.

228
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,700
Some of them have service animals.  Keep an eye out for them.

229
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,440
In terms of finding these participants.

230
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,260
There are local and national Federation for the Blind chapters all across the United States.

231
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,720
Those are a great place to start.

232
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,440
There's a lot of special interest groups that use assistive technology.

233
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,040
Universities, particularly the larger ones are a great place to go.

234
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,900
Most the universities and the governments have been under much stricter rules around accessibility

235
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,620
for a much longer period of time.

236
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,960
So most larger universities have an office for accessibility

237
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:49,000
with staff that helps train the different departments on how to make their

238
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,000
websites and mobile apps accessible.

239
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,080
Most of these universities also have computer labs, on-site with all the technology they need.

240
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,980
And, so, they can definitely point you in the right direction as far as finding folks.

241
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:10,300
Unfortunately, I found the unemployment rate amongst the people with disability is extremely high.

242
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:20,040
So usually having them come and help you is usually not a huge barrier of them not being interested.

243
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,100
And there's also among the community, I found out there also a lot of positive energy.

244
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,520
They want to come in and they want to help you fix your stuff.

245
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:36,400
They really appreciate the fact that you're reaching out to them as well. Which is really, really great.

246
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,800
Here's a project I was on a few years ago where we partnered with the local University.

247
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:52,460
It was great, because I brought in some middle-aged folks to my lab that had accessibility issues.

248
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,180
And they were using screen reader technology for the most part.

249
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,420
They were also using screen magnifying software as well.

250
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,980
And I partnered with this local University.

251
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:08,400
University was really well-known for being open to people with accessibilities in the student body.

252
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,780
and we had several other students step through the same website as well.

253
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,060
What I wasn't anticipating, it almost wasn't a fair fight.

254
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:24,340
Because the blind students, when they came to that University, they had an introductory JAWS course

255
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:30,580
and they came out of that screen reader course with just like super powers.

256
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:37,140
They knew all sorts of power moves, and different power user techniques.

257
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,040
And there wasn't anything we could throw at them that they couldn't master.

258
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,940
Whereas, a lot of the middle age folks that I was dealing with, they were more self-taught.

259
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,680
And what I also discovered through that and other projects is, a lot of times, folks,

260
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,360
hardware and software isn't cheap.

261
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:01,020
So if it works, that's good.  I don't care if I'm couple of versions behind sort of thing.

262
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,420
Whereas, the students in that lab, they were on the latest stuff and they knew all the stuff.

263
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,160
And what actually came out of that was an interesting discussion I had with the professor.

264
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,280
I got hooked up with her.

265
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:20,480
And this student worked on a separate exercise,

266
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:30,460
where we were essentially evaluating someone's proficiency with the JAWS screen reader

267
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,980
we were placing them as beginning, medium, and advance

268
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:40,420
and trying to see what issues were uncovered through that, which was sort of a separate effort.

269
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,400
Which is a whole another discussion.

270
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,380
[Chuckles]

271
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,100
And I'm not sure how that relates to anything involving compliance,

272
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,060
but it was just an interesting take on all that.

273
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,480
So what I did want to do though, I did want to show you an example video.

274
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,740
This is a spoiler alert.

275
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,800
It's a 5-minute video but I'm going to tell you how the story ends.

276
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,000
So there's a friend of mine.

277
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,080
And I'm having him step through a newly redesigned website at the Ohio State University

278
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,780
on seeking financial aid.

279
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
And they recently had a vendor come in.

280
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,360
And the vendor was very well-versed in accessibility and they redesigned that with that in mind

281
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,060
and it works great.

282
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,000
And at a particular point, he's interested in a particular scholarship.

283
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,720
And he goes to another website and that's not so great.

284
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,240
Because that site has not been given that sort of treatment.

285
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,720
So let me queue that up.

286
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Let me see if I can get this to go.

He's a power user.  He's a developer as well.

312
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,280
And he purposely slowed down the speed of the slow reader so I can understand it.

458
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,100
So this is sort of the bad example.

459
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,260
For the most part, the first website was fairly straightforward and it went and announced

460
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,520
1 in 7 of the tab, and 2 of 7.

461
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,840
This one is just a giant link farm

462
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,460
and all he wants to do is find the application for it.

463
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:24,340
So, he could get through this.  It just wasn't ideal per se.

464
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,460
So in conclusion.

465
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,580
It's my belief is that usability testing with people with disabilities,

466
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,880
highlights issues that are difficult to uncover

467
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,160
any other way.

468
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,540
They highlight unique issues

469
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,100
that other methods just won't

470
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,680
address necessarily.

471
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,860
And I'm not dismissing code scans.

472
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
I'm not dismissing human evaluations.

473
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,440
I believe all three can work together

474
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,100
and give you the best solution altogether.

475
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,860
I'm also under the belief that when you focus on accessibility,

476
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,340
ultimately it improves the user-experience.

477
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,560
You saw the difference between those last two websites

478
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,560
we just walk through on the video.

479
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,780
The first one had a much simpler UI to it.

480
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:47,440
And any website or application or mobile app

481
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,540
that's I've been part of that's under gone accessibility review,

482
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
it tends to simplify the interface.

483
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,160
It tends to strip out many of the options.

484
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,300
And all of those are tenants of user-experience,

485
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,940
whether you're a content writer,

486
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,840
an interaction designer, or user researchers,

487
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,460
those are all the things we can get behind.

488
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,360
So from my standpoint,

489
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:15,580
accessibility really serves user-experience very well for all people.

490
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,040
And ultimately, I believe that where this comes down to

491
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,040
is whether or not the client wants to be compliant

492
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,040
or whether or not they're interested in delighting the end-users no matter who they are.

493
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,820
And I understand the reason to try to get out from under the throng of the litigation

494
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,160
To try to get that off to the side,

495
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,100
but ultimately, we do serve a larger population.

496
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:53,660
And what I've also found is that it really helps with client relationships.

497
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,760
One last story.

498
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,820
I was working for a financial services company.

499
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:08,920
And they held the public retirement funds for a very large state in the country.

500
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,980
They were the custodian for that.

501
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:17,320
And for that individual state, there was a woman who reported straight to the governor

502
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,700
and she was in charge of accessibility.

503
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:26,820
And she caught wind of the website that my client had for the employees of that state,

504
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,060
the government employees.

505
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,180
And she was not happy.

506
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,680
She was very upset.

507
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,740
And it was doing everything wrong you could imagine.

508
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,580
Not only for people who were blind, but everybody else in between.

509
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,700
It was just not a good website.

510
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,620
And when they came on-site,

511
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,660
and they saw the usability lab and saw what they were doing,

512
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,260
to try to help mitigate what was wrong,

513
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,000
it really made a good impression on her from a client perspective.

514
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,740
That we were going to that extent to try to make it right.

515
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,720
So I'm not saying that's the only reason you wanted to do this, to try to win over a client.

516
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,980
But it really does show you're all in when you do something like that,

517
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:18,520
that you're really committed to making something as useable as possible for as many people as possible.

518
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,980
And with that, I will open the floor up for any questions you might have.

519
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,620
Yes...

520
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,200
[Attendee]: Hi, I really liked your presentation.

521
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:47,820
I had a question about in testing.  Have you done remote testing?

522
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
[Richard]:  Right, remote usability testing.

523
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,880
[Dennis]: Richard, could you repeat the question?

524
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,180
[Richard]: So the question was have I ever done remote use ability testing with people with disabilities?

525
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,360
Actually my friend that was in video tape was going to do that with me here tonight.

526
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:14,620
He told me that most of the web conference software, Skype and the like are not accessible.

527
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,940
So essentially, he needs to have someone with him.

528
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,960
His wife is sighted and he's friends are sighted. But they would need to be with him.

529
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,960
in order to make that go.

530
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,220
He told me he'd be happy to do that, but then it all fell apart.

531
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,800
And I'm going to bring it over to his office this weekend and do that.

532
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:40,000
Because actually, the videos I've done for clients are all under confidentiality agreement so I can't show you.

533
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,160
But it is possible. I just think it would take a sighted person on the other end

534
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,240
to help them out if things didn't work out.

535
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,500
I'm a big fan of remote usability testing in general.

536
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:58,700
Because I find that I get better show rates and people are much less likely to bail.

537
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,080
They're using their own hardware and software which is great.

538
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,160
I can see what their screen resolution is set at.

539
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,880
If there's noise in the background, that's great.

540
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,560
That's the way you're trying to get things done with whatever it is you're using.

541
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:20,640
But, yeah, potentially in that case, for someone with visual handicap, they might need a visual person as well.

542
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,640
That's a great question.

543
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,140
Yes?

544
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:36,540
[Attendee]: [Away from mic]

545
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,940
[Richard]: Yes, so the question was how many participants do you need?

546
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,020
In general, there's a rule of thumb in our field, that goes back many years.

547
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:51,020
You need a minimum of 4 or 5 people to see the majority of issues coming up again and, again.

548
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:57,320
This is somewhat anecdotal, but I haven't found I need quite that many.

549
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:04,180
Typically, if something is broken, for the first person, it's broken for the second and third as well.

550
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:10,180
It kind of gets to that issue I brought up a moment ago about the proficiency that the people have with the tool

551
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,320
and why they're not able to overcome that.

552
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,580
Which I don't think any of the legislation deals with at all

553
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:20,920
whether you're making it accessible for people ... proficiency or not.

554
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,780
But that's another whole can of worms for another night.

555
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,920
I have found that usually after about 2 or 3 folks, we can usually see the same patterns.

556
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,980
Yes? I'm sorry, back there.

557
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,220
[Attendee]: [Away from mic]

558
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,020
[Richard]: The question was, when did I begin accessibility testing?

559
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,960
I was working for a software division within IBM.

560
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:55,680
And my user-experience manager at the time realized we had not done much with that and said, here you go.

561
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Go do it.

562
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:03,940
And I met this amazing woman. She was blind. And she worked in one of our offices.

563
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:10,700
And there, at that point in time, they pretty much said have her look at it.

564
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,820
Have her look at it.

565
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,740
So she showed up to work everyday and they just had her trying to use whatever software

566
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,600
they were working on and she would tell them what worked and what didn't work.

567
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,540
So it was very informal, but it was great that they were doing that.

568
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,880
And that's how I got introduced to it.

569
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,560
I met some really amazing people.

570
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,060
IBM has an accessibility center.

571
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,940
They have spun out a whole consulting group out of that as well

572
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,000
that does consulting with all sorts of companies working around accessibility as well

573
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and they're really committed to it.

574
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,860
Actually, I went with that woman to the CSUN conference.

575
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:53,480
I was just talking to Dennis about this. There's this really great disability conference out near the L.A.X. airport.

576
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,000
And for many years, they had it in the same two hotels.

577
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,280
And the participants wouldn't let them move, because some of the participants were blind

578
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
and they knew how to get everywhere.

579
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,360
I go down to the elevator, I go 15 feet forward to the right and there's the bar.

580
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,520
[Laughter]

581
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah, I got go with her to that conference.

582
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,700
And you get to meet Stevie Wonder there too because he lives in L.A.

583
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:27,820
And they have an amazing vendor area, you see some amazing vendors coming up with these crazy futuristic

584
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:32,820
pieces of hardware and software for accessibility that are just mind-blowing.

585
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,520
And that's what Stevie comes for.

586
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:40,480
[Dennis]: This past year at CSUN, Stevie was checking out the device that was similar to Echo.

587
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,940
So he was talking in to it and listening to what it was returning.

588
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,420
[Richard]: And his body guard was 6-foot 6 and about 400 pounds?

589
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,940
[Dennis]: I thought it was his bass player.

590
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,200
[Richard]: Yes?

591
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:02,200
[Attendee]: So you're talking about usability testing and you would go at slow pace?

592
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:11,960
Do your metrics change?  Like is it more informal or how do your metrics change smart ability?

593
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:19,660
[Richard]: So question was around usability testing and what metrics apply around learnability

594
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,300
and how those change.

595
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,560
In other settings, I have used timeline task and error rates.

596
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,540
And I find those don't apply quite as well.

597
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,920
Sort of the slower pace piece I was talking about as well, you need to allow time for them to get comfortable.

598
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:42,400
So if they're coming into your lab, and they have to adjust the speed setting.

599
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,180
They have to figure out how to use your mouse

600
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,540
and there's a lot of things that aren't quite the way that they prefer it.

601
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,700
Sometimes you're using a different version of the software.

602
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,460
So in general, with that, plus the general speed of it,

603
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:04,400
I feel like there's a lot of things that don't apply that I might use normally in terms of evaluating something.

604
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,080
And definitely it tends to be much more conversational and much more informal.

605
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,400
But as they're going through, trying to complete different tasks,

606
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:21,880
you're usually starting to see the same issues come up again and, again, with the participants.

607
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,500
I don't know if I answered your question.

608
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,380
I tried.

609
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,160
[Laughter]

610
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,160
[Richard]: No, that was a great question though.

611
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,040
Did you have a question?

612
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:38,020
[Attendee]: I had a question. When you're doing usability testing, you talked a lot about users who are blind,

613
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:43,560
but there are people with variety types of disabilities and captures different challenges.

614
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:49,700
Do you ever do usability testing for people with physical disabilities?

615
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:55,140
Or hearing impairments?  Or kind of a wider range of disabilities?

616
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:58,620
[Richard]: That's a great question. The question is, with usability testing,

617
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:03,660
do you test with people that just have visual handicap or others as well?

618
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,220
That's a great question.

619
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:12,000
To date, the clients that I worked with made the decision whether it was a good decision or not,

620
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,660
but they could master the vast majority of issues if they focus on people with visual handicap.

621
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:23,040
Whether that's right or not, I think that's open for debate.

622
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,960
And it would probably take whole another hour presentation on that.

623
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,620
But to date, that's been the focus.

624
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:38,100
I have been working with some different clients of late that are taking a different tact.

625
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:43,400
And I'm looking forward to try to bring in people who have motor issues as well.

626
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:50,620
I think there's definitely a whole host of disabilities that we could bring in

627
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:56,700
that I think with this current client I have, we're definitely going to need to address that.

628
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,240
And what's great about having a relationship with the University is,

629
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,340
the students, they span all those disabilities

630
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:11,260
It's a really easy way to quickly find people that have a variety of disabilities that you can tap into.

631
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,860
That's a great question.

632
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:14,540
Yes?

633
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,540
[Attendee]: I have a follow-up question to that.

634
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:27,300
So when you're testing with people, like for visual, you also, like, four or five people use screen reader

635
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,160
and four or five people on magnifier?

636
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,980
[Away from mic]

637
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,600
[Richard]: Right, So the question was in terms of recruiting participants,

638
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:48,080
do you split them up 4 or 5 with a screen reader versus screen magnifier?

639
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:54,640
I think a lot of it depends on your budget and the time to go get through.

640
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,760
Obviously, the more participants, the more money you have to spend and longer it takes.

641
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,060
What I have found in general is if I have code on a prototype,

642
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:13,060
if it's already been released, this is post production testing and we're close to a production release,

643
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,100
that's when it makes sense to bring in people that have screen readers.

644
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:24,260
When I have folks probably more in a validation stage where we have the finished visual design,

645
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:30,500
that's when it makes sense to bring in the folks to have the screen magnifying type issues.

646
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:37,220
So I wouldn't necessarily bring 10 people in altogether and half of each in one setting.

647
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,000
I would try to space it where it makes sense.

648
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,960
Because I'm trying to feed information to my designer and my developers

649
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,360
to change things as rapidly as possible.

650
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,140
If I have something that's finished visually, but doesn't have code behind it,

651
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,600
we can address that before we jump to the next stage.

652
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,780
I don't know if that made sense or not?

653
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:03,020
[Attendee]: Yeah. The last part is another question I had.

654
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,960
[Richard]: That's a great question.

655
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,460
Yes?

656
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,060
[Attendee]: My question is just some observations ...

657
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:27,120
[Away from mic]

658
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,280
[Attendee]: Carousel for an example.

659
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,500
[Away from mic]

660
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,100
[Richard]: Patterns that create obstacles for people with disabilities?

661
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,780
What I've noticed, and something that someone shared with me from IBM and it made a lot of sense.

662
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,140
And he shared this with me about 10 years ago and I think it's still true.

663
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:58,360
Because I just had a conversation with somebody this week about the developers on the team

664
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:03,340
are falling in love with this framework from Facebook called React.

665
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:09,760
And they feel like they have to develop that in order to get the most talented developers to work on it

666
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,560
and they get the "cool factor" with what we're developing.

667
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,800
But when I bring in my accessibility consultant and we're working together,

668
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:25,580
it just forces the code that comes out of it as inaccessible.

669
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:33,620
And, so, what I've seen play out over and over again is the technology leads, the accessibility catches up.

670
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:39,580
And by the time you figure it out, we've already moved on a generation or two ahead.

671
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,180
For example, when Flash came out, that was the deal.

672
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,540
You could demand $100 an hour if you can develop cool things to Flash.

673
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:52,340
And, so, tons of hours and money were spent to make Flash accessible.

674
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,740
Does anybody care about that today?

675
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:55,920
No.

676
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,540
We were couple of generations past that now.  We've gone to HTML 5.

677
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:05,340
Twitter bootstrap. We're in React. We've moved past that.

678
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:09,820
And, so, it's this constant catch up where the technology gets out in front,

679
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:14,980
and then finally we figure out the accessibility and we've already -- that's more of what I've seen.

680
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:21,780
It's just really hard, if you want to develop the latest and greatest technology to make that accessible.

681
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:23,560
Yes?

682
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:33,880
[Attendee]: [Away from mic]

683
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,540
[Richard]: I'm not a coder.

684
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:42,500
So I'm probably not the best person to ask, but I do know that if you are going to make something,

685
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:51,200
just lockdown type accessible, typically you're giving up a lot for the sighted community.

686
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,920
There's always a tradeoff.

687
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:59,440
[Dennis]: There's been articles, recently, if you Google articles on frameworks and accessibility,

688
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,400
they have actually done a rundown. Each framework has its own issues.

689
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:12,820
But the general problem is, especially, when you're dealing with custom code, custom elements and such,

690
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:20,160
you know, if you have a form button, it has everything you need to do what you need to do.

691
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:27,080
If you create your own button using custom elements and such, you have to bake that stuff in.

692
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,260
You have to bake in what it communicates to assistive technology.

693
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,860
How it acts when you use a keyboard.

694
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,300
So there's nothing wrong with frameworks.

695
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:42,480
But just know that depending, there's an overhead for accessibility.

696
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,880
[Richard]: Yeah, and I think Facebook, for whatever it's worth,

697
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,280
they're probably ahead of everyone else.  I'm making React accessible,

698
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:57,240
so my client is now making calls to California to try to figure it out.

699
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,480
Because they have accessibility people on staff and they're obviously doing something beyond

700
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,460
what the run-of-the-mill folks are doing already.

701
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,400
Yes?

702
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:14,260
[Attendee]: What advice do you have for a young designer who may not be able to work for a company

703
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:21,540
that values accessibility but, able to implement -- what are the ways to implement from the bottom up?

704
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,540
If the company isn't valuing accessibility out right?

705
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:29,660
[Richard]: So the question is how can someone work with a company

706
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:34,620
that is not ready to take on accessibility? And in a true forthright way?

707
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,760
I've definitely been in that situation.

708
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,600
I was telling someone earlier, I did some work for an insurance company.

709
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,840
And the bread winner there was auto insurance.

710
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:54,660
And myself and some other people were trying to get things done right with accessibility, we were laughed at,

711
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,960
because they said blind people don't buy car insurance.

712
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,080
That's fine.

713
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,200
But that's where all the investment was.

714
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,260
And yet, this company still sold renter's insurance.

715
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,960
So that code migrated down to renter's insurance.

716
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:16,400
So if you're here, why not fix the mother ship while you're fixing everything else, in my mind.

717
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:22,900
So essentially, we did a lot of work around making presentations,

718
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,520
showing what was accessible and not accessible.

719
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,860
Particularly around the things that are publicly available.

720
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,120
That's how we got a chance to go work with that University.

721
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:42,160
We were able to have the students run against the website, the screen readers,

722
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,680
because it was already outside the firewall, they didn't need VPN access, so we used that along with

723
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,680
highlight reels to try and build awareness.

724
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,720
And it wasn't until they got in trouble with violation compliance letters

725
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,740
and clients themselves being less than happy that we finally started getting traction.

726
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:07,080
So you're kind of laying the ground work, if you will, for the bomb to drop.

727
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,080
[Laughter]

728
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,200
[Dennis]: We've got time for one last question.

729
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,600
[Richard]: One last question. Yes?

730
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:23,320
[Attendee]: So my question is, well, when does it make sense to bring in users

731
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,400
into accessibility usability evaluation?

732
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,880
Because during the auto checks, like the human evaluations and you catch these human mistakes.

733
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,300
So does it make sense to bring in someone else?

734
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:47,300
And when you do run a session, do you bring in one or two key... And just have them in that one test?

735
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,840
Ok, so the question was...

736
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,480
[Dennis]: Go for it.

737
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,280
[Laughter]

738
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,960
When does it make sense to bring in people who are visually handicapped

739
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:04,120
for usability test and does it make sense to bring them in with in sighted users as well?

740
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,240
Yeah, that's a great question.

741
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,320
If you are, obviously if you are in a compliance situation,

742
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,760
I think it makes sense if you are going to do that human evaluation, the code scan,

743
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,700
trying to get yourself up to compliance as quickly as possible.

744
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,140
I would wait until they try to fix the majority of those issues

745
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:32,660
before we then try to test with people who have disabilities.

746
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:39,800
In development efforts, I think it makes the most sense to bring in people with screen magnifiers

747
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,160
as early as possible when you have some visual comps.

748
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,800
You've got a visual prototype to show them, particular around color contrast issues

749
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:58,960
As well as once you have functioning code that a screen reader can read, bring them in as soon as possible.

750
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,420
In terms of bringing them in with sighted users as well,

751
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,760
another technique that I've worked with with some of my co-workers in the past,

752
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,000
is something we called garage band testing.

753
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:18,900
And that is set up for an agile methodology. Because one of the challenges of agile for a UX person

754
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,860
is you're constantly spitting out small bits of work.

755
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:28,140
And you never have enough to build a whole usability test around, until it's too late.

756
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,340
And so with garage band testing, we would take different components of that

757
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:39,100
that's coming out of the agile work and we'll run one participant against three small projects over an hour,

758
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,620
so you're getting the feedback sooner.

759
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,340
And I have experimented that particularly if there's finished code,

760
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:51,480
and bringing in people who are blind at that point as well to try to get that input as quickly as possible.

761
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:57,120
With agile, hopefully you can throw your issue in sooner to get it addressed.

762
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,940
[Dennis]: Thank you very much!

763
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,940
[Applause]

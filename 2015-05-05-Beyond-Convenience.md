Okay, well thank you all for coming out and spending your own time, and I’m really, really excited to see the accessibility meetup. They’ve been very instrumental in other cities, so I think it’s a really good sign that Chicago has one. I follow you on Twitter, and watch what’s going on, so it’s particularly exciting to have a special session because I was in town. I love coming to Chicago, it’s funny because once I come, my time gets filled up. It’s always good filled up.

Background-wise, I was born very premature. The amount of oxygen that was necessary to save my life caused my blindness, which is not that uncommon during that day and time. However, I was premature enough, probably even today, that would have happened. I had very low vision as a child until I was fourteen. So I went all the way through seventh grade in public  went to the school for the blind, and then learned all the blindness skills; braille, had to walk with a cane, basically how to be blind. Part of that, I had really no training in terms of being a low vision person.

Career wise, I spent half of my work career in blindness rehab, teaching folks blindness skills, a lot of that related to tech. I was always using some of the newest tech.

21
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,480
In fact, many times I wanted it to fail so, I was kind of the person who tried not to have it fail.

22
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,780
So that was kind of fun.

23
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,940
And then the last half of my career was disability policy.

24
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:11,480
I got to work in the arena of justice when the American’s with Disabilities Act was signed.

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,480
It was a fun time, it was a really open time to train about disabilities

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:25,320
and then an open time to allow policy to have its impact on disability issues.

27
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,560
So that was a lot of fun.

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,240
Now, in retirement, since 2008,

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,760
my husband laughs when I say that because I do a lot in retirement.

30
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,500
But I’ve always wanted to work in accessible travel,

31
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,040
and I met Eric at Open Doors.

32
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,780
I also serve on the National Council on Disabilities,

33
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,780
and we met in Chicago and so it occurred to me that

34
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,260
I could meet these great people at Open Doors.

35
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,220
I had used information on their website, but never met them.

36
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,800
So I met them at that meeting and that started a whole relationship.

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,040
So now I’ver done things with Open Doors for the last six or seven years.

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,700
And that’s been a lot of fun.

39
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,860
They specialize in accessible travel kinds of issues.

40
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,420
Thinking back, just to give you a perspective,

41
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,320
I got my first mobile phone about ten years ago.

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,080
It was just as smart phones were coming out,

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,960
and I didn’t have a cell phone,

44
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,120
but a lot of my blind friends did.

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,140
And they kept saying “I don’t need this phone to talk or anything because I can use it.”

46
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,500
I said “What do you do with that phone?”

47
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,100
And they said “I can take calls and I can make calls. What else do I need to do?”

48
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:43,176
Well, they had not concept that cell phones even did more.

49
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:45,616
What you don’t know, you don’t know.

50
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:54,576
I knew they did a lot more and I wanted to participate in the fuller functions.

51
00:03:54,576 --> 00:04:01,476
To give you an idea, you couldn’t go into a phone store and get information about accessibility.

52
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:05,716
I didn’t exist. I tried, I just tried to see what would happen.

53
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:08,116
It was not fun, for any party.

54
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:13,456
You basically had to buy a $500 smart phone, sight unseen,

55
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:17,096
so I had no idea if I liked this phone.

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,940
$200 piece of software.

57
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,520
Hope that you could install it and that you even liked it once you got it.

58
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,420
And then the funniest thing is my son was in his 20’s at that time.

59
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,300
He walked by and said, “You get a camera phone, what’s wrong with that picture?”

60
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,560
[Laughter]

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,780
I said “Well, I had to have a camera phone to be able to run this software.

62
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,220
Anyway, it was ok, it was hard to use, not a good UI,

63
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,380
but it was so cool to be able to figure out who’s call I missed,

64
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,260
even though if I had a voice mail.

65
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,760
New and novel; a totally different experience.

66
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,720
It started me on a path to understand the potential of smart phones.

67
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,200
So I had that phone for about 4-5 years,

68
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,780
then a phone came out that ran a piece of software called the Canopy Reader.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,280
It’s kind of like a scanner that would read the document to you.

70
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,200
The thing is, to get blind people to do that,

71
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,980
it’s actually not hard to get sighted people to do it,

72
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,200
but to get blind people to do it, we take lousy pictures.

73
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,660
[Laughter]

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,560
It’s kind of inherited in the disability.

75
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,560
You know, we skew it one way, this way, up, down, any way you can skew it, we skew it.

76
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:44,269
And we don’t know if we’re holding it the right way up, whatever.

77
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:52,560
So the software has to be pretty magical to get anything to print out of what we’re doing.

78
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,780
So the Canopy Reader did that.

79
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,460
So another expensive cell phone with expensive software, but it worked.

80
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,820
I still didn’t like the UI, I didn’t like it hardly at all. But I loved the reader.

81
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,660
Well, I had that phone for a year and a half, and it was an ok phone,

82
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,569
and then I went to a meeting at what was then the Continental Advisory Committee,

83
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:21,609
and Jared Miller, who now is with the Falcons IT department.

84
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,320
So now I talk to him about sports apps, which is fun.

85
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:33,420
He asked at one of our meetings if the Continental iPhone app was accessible?

86
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,560
Well, I was the only blind person on the board, I said “I don’t know, because I don’t have an iPhone.”

87
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,140
I went home and I felt so bad about that.

88
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,840
So one day, I told my husband “you know what, let’s go to the Apple store.”

89
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,720
What I did, I sent him the Apple guidance on making your app accessible, which he probably already had.

90
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,520
I said “you know, this is a really bad answer to your question, but, you know, it’s the only one I have.”

91
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,920
But anyway, I told my husband “ look, if they can sell this appropriately to me, I might end up buying an iPhone.”

92
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,920
Because I knew I could always use the reader on the old phone, even if it wasn’t a phone.

93
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:21,360
So I thought “well, I can do it.” So we did, and indeed, they treated me truly like a customer.

94
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,880
They didn’t have to find somebody special that knew the special way to do the Voiceover and all that stuff.

95
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,580
The only mistake I made was, Apple stores are notoriously noisy, so it was very hard to hear.

96
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,200
So the word in the blindness community is if your going there, to take your earphones with you.

97
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,920
Because it really does help in understanding things.

98
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,634
But one thing I clearly remember, she said “what do you want to use the phone for?” I thought “boy is that a stupid question.”

99
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:58,114
So I said “a phone.” And of course I’m sure she just laughed, because that’s the tail-tell question that the person has no idea of what all they are buying.

100
00:07:58,114 --> 00:08:01,654
So she sold it to me appropriately.

101
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:09,794
Knew VoiceOver, knew how to turn it on, trained me to some extent. I was very happy with it.

102
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:12,914
There definitely is a learning curve.

103
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:20,574
Apple basically had to teach all of us that we could us a flat screen device, because none of us had ever done that.

104
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:27,934
We had also never used a device based on sound alone. We always had something tactile, like keys.

105
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,240
So it was a very interesting experience.

106
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:41,460
It was frustrating to learn, but you just have to realize that you are not going to learn it all at one time.

107
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:52,060
Fortunately, there was a couple of books that just came out on using your iPhone with VoiceOver, one of which I got, which was helpful.

108
00:08:52,060 --> 00:09:00,040
So I began to explore and to learn, and “wow,” it was amazing.

109
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,980
Most times when people talk about accessibility, they do just one or two things.

110
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,440
Things like calendars never get done because they’re hard.

111
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,260
Things like maps never get done because they’re hard.

112
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:20,860
Its often times you get part of the device but not the whole banana.

113
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:31,360
Well, Apple being a walled garden, being the maker of the hardware and the OS and the screen reader and the apps,

114
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:42,620
did an absolutely career changing, bar setting approach to accessibility.

115
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:49,300
I never thought I would hold in my hand something that I had been describing for years,

116
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,660
called a device that was universally designed.

117
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,500
Particularly one that did as much as the iPhone did.

118
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:05,540
They gave us that. We now not only can talk about it, we can demonstrate it. I am still amazed.

119
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:14,240
I certainly learned a lot of the techniques, the way Apple does it.

120
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,920
In case people don’t know, is obviously if I touch something and activate it,

121
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,200
I wouldn’t know what I touched until it was already activated.

122
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,300
Well, that doesn’t work very well.

123
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,920
So they broke it into two steps.

124
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,260
When I turn VoiceOver on and I touch an icon, it highlights it, but it is not activated.

125
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,080
So it takes a second tap to activate it.

126
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,460
Then they did something really cool with typing.

127
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,540
Double-tapping each letter when you’re typing is really not too fun;

128
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,640
they discovered that didn’t work very well.

129
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:58,220
I have to say that I have no doubt that Apple did an incredible amount of really good user experience testing,

130
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,340
as they developed all these accessibility features.

131
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:06,540
They could not have come up with the things that they did without doing that.

132
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,380
The other invention that they made was called a rotor.

133
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,780
Remember on the iPod when you had the circular menu?

134
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,860
Well, the sort of mimicked that with a twist motion.

135
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,860
So if I put my thumb and finger down and twist my wrist, with VoiceOver on,

136
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:32,420
it brings up a lot of things that I can adjust, like speech speed, punctuation -

137
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,780
how much of that I want spoken.

138
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,180
For web browsing, it brings up headers.

139
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,620
So the coolest thing is like when I’m using Safari,

140
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,360
and it’s kind of hard using Safari on a small screen,

141
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:53,420
but if I somewhat know the makeup of a site, or even if I don’t, I’ll just turn my rotor to headings.

142
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,320
Then once you get to headings, you just flick down and it jumps you from one heading to another.

143
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,260
It is sweet!

144
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:06,700
And in fact, every time now my son sees me use that, he says “Everybody needs a rotor!”

145
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,200
I say “You have it, just turn on VoiceOver.”

146
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,180
He doesn’t think that’s so funny, and he doesn’t do it.

147
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,960
He keeps complaining that not everybody has a rotor.

148
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,160
And then they threw in some surprise things.

149
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,420
Most people who try to learn VoiceOver have trouble with typing.

150
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,520
What they did with typing to make it better is to create something called touch typing.

151
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,720
What it is is when I bring up the onscreen keyboard,

152
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,900
I have touch typing invoked from the rotor.

153
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,060
I can run my finger on the keyboard to find the key I want,

154
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,580
instead of double-typing;

155
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,140
all I have to do is to lift my finger up, and it chooses that key.

156
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,860
Instead of typing down, you just go up. Brilliant!

157
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,140
Actually, a number of us are pretty decent typers.

158
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,260
When I went to dog training school, which,

159
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,972
by the way, down at my feet is Iris,

160
00:12:56,972 --> 00:13:00,772
she’s my brand new, first trip from home guide dog.

161
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:04,192
And she’s behaved quite well considering she’s not used to it.

162
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,680
Yeah, she’s not used to the long day; she’s only 20 months.

163
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,040
To lay still, meeting after meeting, it’s pretty amazing.

164
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,823
[ Attendee] Boring

165
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:19,200
[ Pat ] Yeah, and to smell everybody’s food, that must be the worst part of a guide dog’s life.

166
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,760
So I wouldn’t volunteer for it. But, she’s done very well.

167
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,240
So basically, that’s how I type.

168
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:38,380
Most people have trouble with typing and trouble with rotor, as they’re teaching themselves how use VoiceOver.

169
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,840
The resident apps are a delight.

170
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,280
And they have grown in their accessibility.

171
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,120
The phone, the calendar, they done very well.

172
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,480
Even when they marked up the calendar, instead if just saying what you’re finger’s on,

173
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,600
which is normally what you would think of for how you would mark it up for speech.

174
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,020
Instead of saying “fourteen,” they said “Tuesday, May 14th.”

175
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,320
“Wow!”

176
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,160
Otherwise, I have to try to track to the top to figure out if it’s Tuesday or not.

177
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,540
Then, track further to figure out if it’s May or not.

178
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,980
They gave me all that.

179
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,280
And in fact on the back buttons,

180
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,460
I always get in trouble when I tell people “well it says back to whatever”

181
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,380
and they say “no, it’s an arrow.”

182
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,240
[laugh]

183
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,360
So, in a way, I get more, because it’ll say “back to settings.”

184
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,420
Well, I even know what I’m going back to.

185
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:33,920
“Wow!”

186
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,320
That’s more than you get.

187
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,400
The day the map app became accessible, I didn’t get anything else done.

188
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,840
I read about it on Twitter.

189
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,760
They use vectors.

190
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,100
And so suddenly, I can even track a street.

191
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,180
You did it by sound.

192
00:14:53,180 --> 00:15:02,200
It would tell you the name of the street, and tell you like north, south, Wind River north south.

193
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,660
So if I wanted to track that, I would start tracking, it does a little tone.

194
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,520
If you’re falling off the track, it changes and makes a lower pitch,

195
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,100
so you just track back to where you were tracking.

196
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,340
It’s not an ideal map, I’m waiting for haptics.

197
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:32,140
There’s still work being done, material-wise, that may be a screen that will slip over your screen,

198
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,860
that would give you raised information.

199
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,240
That would be the most ‘bestest’ thing.

200
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,020
And maps, when you try to do braille maps, first of all,

201
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,480
there’s never enough room.

202
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,780
Second of all, there’s certainly not enough room for words.

203
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,300
So it’s ideal to have a tactile and audio map,

204
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,360
because then all your informational stuff can be audio, which is awesome.

205
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,100
I always forget to, on the Apple map, sometimes they changes what’s in the rotor,

206
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,580
just because they’re Apple and they sort of do that stuff, you know.

207
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,680
And they don’t necessarily tell you.

208
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,740
So I always forget how to zoom in and out.

209
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:17,900
One feature I cannot do is zoom & pinch in and out, because I can’t get perfectly vertical or horizontal.

210
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:23,660
So it thinks I’m doing the rotor command because I’m not lined up perfectly.

211
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,300
So, anyways, I have to work around that.

212
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,580
They put the zoom in and out in the rotor.

213
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,880
And so some people have got even better at geography because they’ll zoom all the way out to get cities,

214
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,220
and sort of learn more relational, where the cities are and stuff like that.

215
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,900
So yes, it’s a real kick.

216
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:52,700
In addition to resident apps, there’s a lot of third-party apps available

217
00:16:52,700 --> 00:17:07,060
Being as they are not real expensive like Windows software was, you can afford to just try something, and see.

218
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,420
Well, a number of us did that, and people started …

219
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:15,640
what I think originally started almost like a Yelp for accessible apps,

220
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,100
its a crowd source thing where blind people could fill out their little form and …

221
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,560
cause we all got tired of buying the same app.

222
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:31,160
Because you also have a hard time getting your money back from Apple, because it is not accessible.

223
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,120
They do have a process now; it’s still not easy.

224
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,400
So, you can look on there and … we put equally inaccessible apps and accessible apps,

225
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,011
because again we all don’t want to be inaccessible ones.

226
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:53,251
But it’s grown to be a site that includes a lot more resources.

227
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,420
There’s a lot of podcasts now, there’s al kinds of podcasts now.

228
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,300
So it’s really fun to watch all that develop.

229
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:09,180
There’s a number of really good podcasts, there’s great ways to learn how to use VoiceOver,

230
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,500
how to use the low vision features,

231
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:19,380
there’s practically anything you would want in that kind of realm.

232
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:26,720
Third-party apps, the first ones I also have people buy, that I bought, is the money-reading app,

233
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,040
because there really isn’t a way to read paper money.

234
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,760
Well, that’s kind of important, because when you travel.

235
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:43,020
It’s a very simple app, people can always learn it, it has no buttons, you just start it, there’s a real-time video.

236
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,300
You lay your paper bill down, you lay your phone on top of it,

237
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,560
then you gradually raise your phone up and it says the denomination.

238
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,400
Awesome. Totally Awesome!

239
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:02,240
So, like when I travel, I always sit down at night and go through all my bills and make sure I know what everything is, to an extent.

240
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,120
So that’s a great … I think it’s a $3 app.

241
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:12,800
The Treasury Service now has a free one that works pretty much the same. Excellent, excellent app.

242
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,760
There’s been various scanner apps, like the one I told you about.

243
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,120
None of them work all that well, particularly with packaging.

244
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,260
But now they’ve … you know that app I told you about on the other iPhone, it’s called the Canopy Reader,

245
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,640
there’s now an iPhone version.

246
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,920
It works extremely well.

247
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:45,500
And it actually gives you an audio indication, an vibratory indication of when you’re holding the phone level.

248
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,520
So it makes your pictures better, which makes your scans better.

249
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:58,240
Although the joke was … I was traveling, and I wanted to know which little bottle was what in the bathroom.

250
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:07,420
So I wanted shampoo. I got the fragrance, not the what. [laughter] It was quite crazy.

251
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:13,980
Gosh, I have probably over 200 apps on my phone.

252
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,680
Reading apps; Kindle finally made their app accessible.

253
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,160
The iPhone reading app is accessible right out of the box.

254
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:30,140
Even the freebie of Winnie the Pooh, they even did really nice descriptions of the pictures.

255
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:35,940
It was a good model for how one should do an accessible book.

256
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,040
Kindle … Amazon got sued for the Kindle device.

257
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:53,460
They made something that was an app … actually a Microsoft software to read.

258
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,060
The first thing they came out with only read the articles.

259
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:04,180
It’s like, if I can’t open it … then, you know, reading it doesn’t much matter cause I can’t get to it without help.

260
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,600
So there was a lot of that stuff going on.

261
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,720
Then they made this software, and it gave me headaches.

262
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:19,840
It was actually about a three to five second pause after every sentence.

263
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:27,200
And it didn’t actually change much even when you speak … sped it up.

264
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,860
You couldn’t speed it up much for one thing.

265
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,500
And even when you did the pause didn’t change.

266
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,540
It’s like if I had to read this book in college, I would have dropped out.

267
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:47,300
There’s a new app that you all might like to hear about. It’s called Be My Eyes.

268
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:55,420
It’s a real-time video, crowd-source assistance app for blind folks.

269
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,720
Blind folks always have hundreds of vision questions.

270
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,900
“Are these my black pants?” “Does this tie match this?”

271
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,340
“What’s the instructions on this package?” You know, on and on and one.

272
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,840
“What medicine is this?” Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

273
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,940
“What captcha is this?” That’s the classic one.

274
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:21,540
Yeah, we all hate captchas, captchas are absolutely terrible. Audio captchas are equally bad in my view.

275
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:27,380
My threshold is “if I can’t do it in three tries, it’s terrible.”

276
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:35,100
And, I’ve never found one yet on an airline app that I could use. So, they don’t work.

277
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,920
Anyway, this has been out for a few months.

278
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,300
I noticed that Product Hunt gave them a huge plug.

279
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:51,060
So what a cool thing, for a blindness related app to get plugged at a place like Product Hunt. Wow!

280
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,600
So it’s helping them get other kinds of funding.

281
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:00,280
So you can sign up as a volunteer … okay … and I didn’t sign-up as a volunteer,

282
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:07,140
so I don’t know if you get to put in hours or maybe you just answer your phone, if you feel like it, whatever.

283
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:18,200
`Anyway, when I request help, then it looks for somebody … and it looks for somebody who speaks the same language my phone is set to.

284
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,520
So it gives me English.

285
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,300
And then when they answer, I just ask them my question.

286
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:31,800
And the person I got had answered while they were driving, so they said “let me pull over, and I would be happy to help you.”

287
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,800
And I had them read some package directions to me, which they did, and they were very happy.

288
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:45,940
So, it’s something that, it’s very easy for people to do. And yet it’s a very needed service.

289
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:52,840
So, I’m very excited about it. Using the real-time video helps a lot.

290
00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:00,040
There was a picture-taking service like that, but people would forget to turn on the light, well duh, you know.

291
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,720
A lot of people don’t see lights so they don’t miss lights, so they don’t do very good about thinking about light.

292
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:24,780
Or even if they … [Iris, down] …

293
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:34,560
So, on the picture taking app, they were forever having to say “Take a different picture” or “turn the light on” or, you know, do the camera more to the left or right.

294
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:42,860
Well, with the video, can’t you just say “move the camera” so you don’t have all this back and forth and wait … you know, all that kind of stuff.

295
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:51,280
Twitter and Facebook have become more accessible in the last few years, particularly with the mobile apps.

296
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:58,200
And so I have gotten much more interested in Twitter, and if anyone wants to follow me, I’m @PatPound1.

297
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:06,640
I do a lot of re-tweeting of accessibility stuff. So if you want to look at my past stuff, it’s a pretty good collection.

298
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:14,660
Sometimes I retweet just because I want to save it. You know, I don’t have to go find it again. It’s easier to find it in my own stuff.

299
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:27,640
Radio. Digital radio, I don’t have to hunt for stuff, I can go directly to stuff. For sports, I use it.

300
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:39,200
There’s a few apps that categorize NFL games, and also College games, by radio.

301
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,580
Well, radio gives me my audio description, right?

302
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:49,380
So that’s what I want, because, it’s a lot more descriptive than the TV.

303
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,640
Then, if I’m watching people with TV, and it’s digital, then we can sometimes sync them.

304
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,260
It depends who’s ahead. If the TV is ahead, then you can pause it, and almost get them in sync.

305
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,000
So it’s really kind of cool, cause that way I don’t  .. find things out.

306
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,400
Games. There’s games galore that actually work.

307
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:18,200
There are some very good developers that have figured out some very cool ways to make games that you wouldn’t even think could be accessible, accessible.

308
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,700
So there’s like tons of that kind of example. It’s like all over the place.

309
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:36,700
And a lot of it is on the Yelp site I was talking about, it’s called AppleVis.com. Apple and Vision, shortened, dot com.

310
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,840
It’s an awesome site! Totally awesome.

311
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:47,020
I use exercise apps.

312
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:52,940
There are some of them that are descriptive enough to where I can follow what they mean by certain exercises.

313
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,180
So that’s pretty cool.

314
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:08,480
I use all kind of travel apps. I use airlines apps. I use all the hotel finder … all those kind of apps.

315
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,540
Let’s see, what else do I use.

316
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:30,660
One of the most fun things. If you have been on Twitter, we finally got NetFlix to add in audio description … video description.

317
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:37,880
There’s been a project at work at NetFlix for a long time with a petition online and everything. A lot of people have signed it.

318
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:48,040
Absolutely no response from NetFlix. In fact, they got sued and the court said, they didn’t have to … they couldn’t be sued I think that’s what they said

319
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:57,800
So, Daredevil came along, and we just couldn’t resist. It’s like “you’re using our superhero, and we don’t get to know?”

320
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:05,580
And then some people said “well, don’t you want something more than just Daredevil?”

321
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,080
And, well, you don’t want to just know about blind superhero, right?

322
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,060
And of course, we said, “right.”

323
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:18,660
I did notice a tweet later that said that Yahoo had been talking with NetFlix.

324
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:29,260
Well, if you didn’t know it, the entity that invented audio description, which is the WGBH PBS station in Boston.

325
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:37,140
Larry Goldberg was the director for years and years and years. He’s a brilliant guy. He now works for Yahoo.

326
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:42,500
It’s like “Oh, SWEET!” [Laugh] Keep talking, keep talking, you made my day when I saw this.

327
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,400
Go Larry.

328
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,960
Yeah, I actually went over to his Facebook page and said yes yes yes yes yes.

329
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,700
So now, NetFlix has a little way to go, because their website is still pretty challenging.

330
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,480
But I can actually go to their app,

331
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:05,240
I can actually turn on the audio description, and I can actually search for and find the movies I want.

332
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,540
Now the bad news is I can’t get to the …

333
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:15,460
they’ve actually added probably more now, a list of 39 tv shows and movies with audio descriptions.

334
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,280
See, it’s out there, they just never put it up.

335
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,020
It’s not like they had to do it for anything but their own stuff.

336
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:29,600
Most nationally released movies have … you’ll hear it called video description most commonly,

337
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,760
NetFlix calls it audio description. Same thing. So they describe what I’m missing. Okay?

338
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:45,020
And in fact in Daredevil, they even describe the technique they use where things are reflected in his sunglasses, they would describe that.

339
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,820
Which I thought that was pretty cool, that’s pretty detailed description.

340
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:54,420
The challenge for description is they have to fit it into the pauses.

341
00:29:54,420 --> 00:30:05,320
Okay? A lot of time, they want to describe a lot more than they do describe, because they’re limited in terms of that.

342
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:17,540
But yeah, I thought it was a wonderful demonstration of what we can do through Twitter and some other things to have won under NetFlix.

343
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:24,760
And you can then tell that they were about to pop their buttons, they did a bunch of “coming soon” tweets.

344
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,920
Well, you don’t do that for bad news, so. Anyway, it definitely kept us interesting.

345
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,437
And I actually even watched Daredevil, which I wouldn’t going to do,

346
00:30:34,437 --> 00:30:38,677
but I was like “if they did it, I’m going to watch it, and then I'm going to tweet about it,

347
00:30:38,677 --> 00:30:42,537
because I want them to know there’s people out there that watched it.

348
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:49,160
A number of other services are quite accessible, Uber’s app is quite accessible.

349
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,240
Instacart, which is a delivery service is quite accessible.

350
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,880
The thing that I really wanted to say today is you know,

351
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:04,060
I think when people hear about access to mobile devices, they tend to think about … you know,

352
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:11,740
it’s really good that blind and people with disabilities are getting some of the same conveniences we are.

353
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:21,440
Well, that’s not untrue. But the difference is there are things that the phone enables me to do that weren’t possible for me to do.

354
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,580
So it’s way beyond convenience for me.

355
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:37,040
I didn’t have a way to read paper money. I didn’t have another way to get help reading directions on a box for food. You know?

356
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:52,040
It’s given me those opportunities. The other thing that Apple really did in really embracing Universal Design was they …

357
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,140
first, they told us we could do a lot of things.

358
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:04,640
But they even have employees who work as floor sales people selling not to just people with disabilities in your stores who are blind.

359
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,200
Well, that’s just pretty awesome. That’s really pretty awesome.

360
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,060
They’ve maintained the commitment over time.

361
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,960
I use a really nice GPS app.

362
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,440
A Russian guy who lives down in Finland, who is probably one of the best developers I have ever encountered.

363
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:34,500
He took the FourSquared data and built a GPS app specifically geared to blind people.

364
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,060
It is totally awesome.

365
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:45,820
It tells me the streets, so now I don’t have to count streets and wonder if I got off or not.

366
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:53,460
It tells you a lot of usual GPS stuff.

367
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,240
I have these neat, cool headphones; I wanted to bring them but my backpack was too full.

368
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:06,540
They’re a little fragile. So I figured the only way I could bring them is to wear them, and I didn’t want to have to explain them to TSA. [laugh]

369
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:11,140
They go around the back, then they come up hear, they sit right here.

370
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,060
They conduct the sound through the cheekbone.

371
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:23,640
Well for me, I get to hear the traffic, through me ears, which I need to hear, without having earphones in my ears, as well as my GPS.

372
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,560
It is so sweet!

373
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,280
I took them to dog school and they let me use them the second week.

374
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:38,440
It was so wonderful to have a dog do what a dog does and then having all the information mentioned to you.

375
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:44,560
Another thing that Apple has done in the last couple of releases is some really cool things.

376
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,800
Remember the rotor? I can dial it to something that says handwriting.

377
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,740
I can actually trace letters, maybe I’ve seen before, which I have.

378
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:59,340
So I know what print letters look like. If I want to enter by tracing print letters I can do that.

379
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:04,060
Now actually I’m a faster touch typer than doing that, but guess what else I get to do?

380
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,720
You’re going to be jealous.

381
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,700
I can’t remember if I told you this, but I don’t think I did.

382
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:17,500
I turn it to handwriting, then maybe I trace an “o.” It gives me all the apps that begin with the letter “o” alphabetized.

383
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,520
Sweet!

384
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,020
So you don’t have to remember what directory, what page, whatever.

385
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,960
Just turn on VoiceOver, go to handwriting, and do it.

386
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,780
Also, braille is written, braille is like six dots, ok?

387
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:43,080
Three down like this on each side, so if you’re looking at it, it’s one two three on your left, four five six on your right.

388
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,200
Braille is made up of one or more of those dots.

389
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,360
Well, to write braille, we use a big, clunky machine; that’s how I did this paper here.

390
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,980
Then we mash down on fingers together.

391
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,540
Like if I wanted the top two dots, I would mash down these two fingers. Because this is one and this is four.

392
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:09,340
Apple developed an onscreen braille keyboard, so they took my fingers, they just turned them, because there’s more space.

393
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:16,220
So I turned my rotor to Braille, I pick up my phone, I’m in an edit field, and I just start brailling.

394
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:24,000
Even with the shorthand stuff I was talking about. It translates really, totally awesome.

395
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,680
I can also use braille the same way to find apps.

396
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,760
So if I braille a “b” and just stop, it lists all the apps that begin with “b.”

397
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,440
So I can start my apps that way. Absolutely, totally cool.

398
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,340
Maybe I should stop and do a time check, and maybe some questions.

399
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,280
[Audience: It’s 7:02]

400
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,040
Ok, that’s probably pretty good. So why don’t we do some questions and discussion.

401
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,320
The meeting I was in all day was talking about the kiosk regulations

402
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,500
and  they were probably sorry that they invited me because I said “take them all out and do mobile.”

403
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,460
[laugh]

404
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,000
[Audience: Yeah.]

405
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,820
Which has been my position all along. So they definitely got it. They know that’s my position.

406
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,060
[Audience member] It’s great to hear, my name is Martin, nice to meet you, Pat.

407
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,640
It was wonderful to hear of the great apps out there.

408
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,160
What app are you missing, that you’d really like to have?

409
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,220
[Pat] Well, somebody recent did it. It was regular ‘ol Solitare.

410
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:27,120
There were all these Solitare games and none of them were accessible.

411
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,660
Somebody finally did it. So that was really cool.

412
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:38,060
I’ve been playing around with something, I was talking about this earlier. I’m fascinated with the haptics.

413
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:45,580
I probably will get a watch at some point in time. One is, something I could use tonight.

414
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:52,240
What if on the watch … right now, you can set the timer, like, right now, I have to give a four minute speech.

415
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,480
But it keeps going, it doesn’t like ding at you at one time. It’s like “ding ding ding ding.”

416
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,976
And so you have to be lightening fast to catch it.

417
00:36:59,976 --> 00:37:06,296
I mean if you’re using a mic you can sometimes hide it far enough away so the mic doesn’t pic it up.

418
00:37:06,296 --> 00:37:10,956
But we all need something to let us know when our time is up when we’re speaking.

419
00:37:10,956 --> 00:37:20,576
So, it’s a perfect watch app, in my view. It would probably be an easy watch app to write. So yeah, that’s one we’re missing.

420
00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:30,716
The GPS is also going to integrate with indoor iBeacons. So that’s going to be really cool.

421
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:37,796
I’ve also been working with Open Doors and IBM on an Android “can you actually believe I’m going this.”

422
00:37:37,796 --> 00:37:43,036
So I did have to tell IBM that people weren’t going to be a separate phone to use their app.

423
00:37:43,036 --> 00:37:53,296
So they are doing an iPhone version. So that will be good.

424
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:57,236
We’ve gotten to actually do some of the airport testing.

425
00:37:57,236 --> 00:38:05,096
It was really fun to work on all that and to see the back-end development that I haven’t been that close to with apps.

426
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:11,196
But to get to work with the engineers and all that kind of stuff. So that was pretty cool.

427
00:38:11,196 --> 00:38:14,316
Trying to think of other apps that we are missing.

428
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:22,160
Indoor nav, everybody’s just salivating about. I wish I had something that I could drop my own points at.

429
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:33,220
Or even if say a hotel didn’t have iBeacons, if I could somehow drop a point in their wi-fi or whatever, and label it myself.

430
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:37,420
So that way I could have where I’ve actually went, like the front desk,

431
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:43,560
my room, the gym, the restaurant, and you know, by a day or so I would have …

432
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,460
oh, I have to tell you this funny thing.

433
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:52,600
I was cleaning out my GPS app, because I had all these personal waypoints that I had marked.

434
00:38:52,600 --> 00:39:00,800
Ok, it wasn’t a name of a business, but I had an overwhelming number of certain things marked.

435
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:08,240
Ok, it wasn’t a … So guess what thing I might, I mean a huge number.

436
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,820
Probably 90% of what I had labeled which is personal things are these things.

437
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,500
[Audience member] I don’t know.

438
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,940
[Pat] I have a guide dog…

439
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,600
[Audience members] Oh…

440
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:30,920
[Pat] What do I need to find? Trash cans! Trash cans are actually harder than the places. Believe it or not.

441
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:38,520
And I think all outdoor trash cans should forced to have iBeacons. [Laugh]

442
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:49,760
I labeled a lot of outside stuff, but not in the inside.

443
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:52,527
Other questions?

444
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:57,587
[Audience member] Hi Pat, I”m a developer at Northwestern University in the Chicagoland area.

445
00:39:57,587 --> 00:40:03,167
I was really intrigued when you talked about Uber being accessible.

446
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:10,427
We’re working on a mobile app right now for students that are concerned with safety, walking late at night.

447
00:40:10,427 --> 00:40:14,727
So we’re going to present them with a map, to kind of specify their destination,

448
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:26,527
and then set a timer about, um, if they don’t reach their destination and cancel their timer, then we notify campus police.

449
00:40:26,527 --> 00:40:38,727
So, as a developer, I’m challenged by how to make a map accessible, how somebody can specify their destination on a map.

450
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,607
So I’m wondering if you can speak to that.

451
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:45,600
[Pat] Well, I wouldn’t say that the Uber map works in particular.

452
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:54,700
But they give you the time estimate. So it’s not as important to see them coming as it is to know when they’re coming.

453
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:00,520
During the period of time when cell phones were coming in and pay phones were disappearing,

454
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,020
blind people had big headaches, because if you hadn’t bought a cell phone yet,

455
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:10,380
you would miss your taxi, you would go inside and have trouble finding a pay phone.

456
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,580
And your taxi would come and leave you. [laugh]

457
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,280
Then you had a real problem, if you had no phone or taxi.

458
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:23,000
I would really look at the access of the Apple map.

459
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,380
I am truly intrigued at how well they were able to do that.

460
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:41,960
The other things is that, not last year’s WWDC but the year before, they did a hotel map for their convention, that I salivated over.

461
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,060
I wasn’t even there, but I was just listing to the session.

462
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:57,520
They had like a, what do you call the box that you can flick through and it changes … a combo box or something like that.

463
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,640
Anyway, for example, if you were at break and you wanted to know where the coffee was, coffee was on the list.

464
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,780
So you could turn that option on or off. Which makes a lot of sense.

465
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:18,400
I mean there’s always things you want on, like elevators, stairs, things like that, that you always want.

466
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:29,800
They didn’t have like the walls drawn, but you could get relational things, like you know on the other side of the escalators were certain meeting rooms.

467
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:38,060
That is a huge amount of help, in an inside environment where you have nothing.

468
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:49,840
Initially Uber had trouble, their rating system wasn’t accessible. But now all that is labeled well.

469
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:57,960
Open Doors has worked with them too because, part of their problem was that riders could rate you.

470
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,800
Well, if I left any dog hair in the car, and they didn’t like dogs, they probably rated me low.

471
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:13,320
And so they started Uber access, which is UberX I think, I can’t remember exactly what it is called in the app.

472
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:21,140
But, those drivers have had more training on disability and they have agreed to have guide dogs and things like that.

473
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,600
There are still problems with some people who don’t want to pick up guide dogs.

474
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,760
It used to be true in D.C., I don’t know if it’s still true, I haven’t been there recently.

475
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,520
But to catch a regular taxi in D.C. with a guide dog,

476
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,160
you had to actually send a person without a dog. A decoy.

477
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:46,700
To actually get in your cab, and not let it go, then you walk out and get in the cab.

478
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,080
That’s how bad it was. Because they would just drive off.

479
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,780
Some other future things. I’m really watching 3-D printing.

480
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,420
I’m so intrigued, I can’t even begin to tell you.

481
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:05,620
We’re having a lot more pictures developed in 3-D, a lot more museum things.

482
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:10,620
Think of things I can’t touch, but there could be models of.

483
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:17,260
All my life, when I’ve traveled, my husband is a great model finder. You know, we hit the cheap curio places.

484
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:23,420
Because I can get a model of the Willis Tower, the Empire State Building, whatever.

485
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,660
Before, so I know what it is like.

486
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,060
Because I can’t get that perspective any other way.

487
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:35,320
But think of historical things that you couldn’t touch. That you could make 3-D models of.

488
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:43,220
In schools they are using it. Anytime one school does pictures of a book, they share the files.

489
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:48,800
So now, all the schools can have it and print it. Oh, sweet!

490
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,460
I could spend the rest of my life being with just 3-D printing, and be very happy.

491
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,540
I don’t even have one, and its just like … following it and all.

492
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:04,080
The whole medical stuff, and mean we’re finding ways to bypass …

493
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:09,120
there’s a really nice summary article recently on the work on vision,

494
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:20,760
so they’re basically bypassing your eye, making your device your eye, your camera, sending signals to your brain.

495
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:28,300
They’ve got it to the point where it’s pretty crude vision, but it is some vision.

496
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,460
You could possibly avoid crashing into big objects.

497
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,307
You might be able to follow the grass line in the sidewalk.

498
00:45:34,307 --> 00:45:42,567
But they know exactly what it is they have to conquer to make it better, and they know they can get there.

499
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:45,387
Wow! It’s like, amazing.

500
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:50,087
[Audience member] So are there impacts, to receive those signals? How do they transmit?

501
00:45:50,087 --> 00:46:00,507
[Pat]  I think right now, yes. I think that’s correct now. So it’s such an interesting world. I’m also very fascinated,

502
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:06,547
Elizabeth started me on this realm of user experience testing

503
00:46:06,547 --> 00:46:12,927
and having people participate like a regular user and having that be part of what companies do.

504
00:46:12,927 --> 00:46:22,387
[Speaking to guide dog]

505
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:28,487
It has so much strength that  am going to do some core testing for Virgin America.

506
00:46:28,487 --> 00:46:38,767
I was challenging Elizabeth to give me user experience language so I can change how I talk from testing to user experience.

507
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:42,927
Because I have a background in doing user experience stuff.

508
00:46:42,927 --> 00:46:47,320
So I want to try to tap into that and make it be that,

509
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,780
even though that’s not exactly what they asked for.

510
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:55,160
Couple of other things. Since I got to learn what I did,

511
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:00,920
I happened to have lunch with a friend of mine that taught vision-impaired kids at a local school district,

512
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,840
and I discovered she had an iPhone. But guess what else I discovered?

513
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:20,300
Even though she taught  [Speaking to guide dog] I discovered she didn’t know how to use VoiceOver.

514
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,260
She didn’t know how to use it with her students.

515
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:29,400
So, for three years I did training of fourteen teachers of vision-impared students in that district.

516
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:38,620
Funny thing, this is a district that didn’t buy Apple devices. So, that was pretty bizarre.

517
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:46,980
So, the first year two teachers had Apple devices and didn’t know how to use them.

518
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:54,440
The second year, about half had Apple devices and were learning to use them.

519
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,040
The third year all but one had Apple devices and had used them with students.

520
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:10,640
This year, they didn’t even have me train, they found enough … online, and their district is buying iPads for high school students.

521
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,880
YES!

522
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,580
I felt very subversive in all that, but rightfully so.

523
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:24,220
But you know the parents were contacting the teachers and saying “teach my kid how to use this low-vision magnifyer app.

524
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:29,100
They didn’t even know what it was. Or where it was, or how to use it.

525
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:35,040
So, yes, it’s fun to see all that develop in various ways.

526
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:43,060
The other group I teach is some older people than me who are totally blind and have low hearing.

527
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:47,880
And it is a stitch, and loud, it’s very loud.

528
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,760
They can’t use earphone because of the hearing aids.

529
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,840
Most of their mistakes are because of lack of hearing.

530
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,660
It’s been very challenging, but they love Siri.

531
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:02,360
And their mouths say things like “I don’t want to do any of that Internet.”

532
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,540
But then they’ll say “but I found this You Tube song that I like.” [laugh]

533
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:10,900
But they’re using Siri to search or they’re using the You Tube app to search.

534
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,080
But they don’t realize that they are on the Internet, and I don’t tell them.

535
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,720
Don’t tell them. You know … they’re doing it.

536
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,420
So really, they’re wanting what people tell us all the time.

537
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,780
We want it to be easier.

538
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,480
We want it to meet our needs and we want it to do what we want,

539
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,760
without having to know where I am or what I’m on.

540
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:34,080
So yeah, they teach me a lot too. So it’s real fun.

541
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:37,386
[Audience]: Well, it's 7:16.

542
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:50,260
[Pat] Yeah, I'll probably have to run soon, in fact, that's Laurel telling me don't be late, I'm taking the taxi with you, and don't leave me.

543
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:59,080
And the bad thing about speech on phones, if you go and stick your earphone in, whatever comes in with your text is read right out.

544
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:07,700
Well, I'm happy to answer a couple more questions...

545
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:21,860
[Audience] I have a question. There is a ... obviously you're big on Twitter. So am I.

546
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:29,020
There is an app called Easy Chirp. Do you use it? Do you like it?

547
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:41,580
Just so everyone knows, Easy Chirp is a web-based Twitter app that basically allows you to provide alternative text for images that you put into your posts.

548
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,960
Do you find it convenient?

549
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:52,500
[Pat]: I don't use it because I typically use Twitter on my phone.

550
00:50:52,500 --> 00:51:00,220
But I love the fact that there's apps that allow you to put alternative text with pictures.

551
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:07,800
And I wish Twitter would do better with that. That's something they need to correct.

552
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:15,500
Particularly now that they let you retweet the things, and have the extra spaces to talk.

553
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:24,860
So yeah, that's a weakness. And like a lot of blind people, we tweet things with images because we don't know what those are.

554
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,500
Which is probably a good policy.

555
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:39,540
But yes, it's a very good effort, I just wish ... there's another one that I just love, that I wish was on iOS.

556
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:45,200
And that's the description app. That allows you to describe You Tube videos.

557
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,700
You Describe. Yes, You Describe.

558
00:51:47,747 --> 00:51:51,507
I think it's a cool effort, I know the guy is a really cool guy.

559
00:51:51,507 --> 00:51:54,907
He cracked me up. He said growing up, he always wanted to be a lumberjack.

560
00:51:54,907 --> 00:51:56,220
[laughter]

561
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:02,860
I laughed out loud at that tweet. Actually, I could see that guy as a lumberjack. That is what was so funny about it.

562
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:08,380
But it's this great side gig ... Josh Meele ... yeah. He's a cool dude.

563
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:13,260
In fact, when I'm in San Francisco, I'm going to call him up, get together. It would be fun.

564
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:18,369
Yeah, there's just such exciting things happening.

565
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:24,200
But you know, it's as good as the access is.

566
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:30,100
Anybody that can interface with access, like you guys with the meetup,

567
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:36,060
with Global Accessibility Day, whatever you can do to keep the fire lit, and help people understand

568
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,900
iOS access is not that hard.

569
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:45,460
The more tools there are for web access, the harder it is, I think, for access.

570
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,320
But iOS access is not that hard.

571
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,800
And so actually that's why I like working in the mobile area so much.

572
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,760
Because I think it's easier to get stuff.

573
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,562
Now the bad news is its easier for it to change.

574
00:53:00,562 --> 00:53:07,262
So we all hesitate when there's new updates to apps that we use frequently.

575
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,220
[Audience]: And so do we.

576
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:08,720
Yeah,

577
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:18,240
[Pat]: But what we do is we figure out who blinks first on AppleVis ... you keep going to see who's knuckled.

578
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,700
...and what they're going to say about it, before you're going to have to change it.

579
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:30,100
Some of us hold on to old apps because, we figure we're dead if we update them.

580
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,940
So we'll see how long they last.

581
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,520
Yeah, we play that game a lot.

582
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,700
Thank you very much for coming at a non regular scheduled time,

583
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:49,540
I’m impressed. I love Chicago more and more every time I’m here. And I think even Iris likes Chicago.

584
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,060
It's a good thing.

585
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:57,120
[Dennis]: Well, thank you for presenting for us. And sharing your experiences. Thank you.

586
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:09,800
[Applause]

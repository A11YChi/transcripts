# Standards, Design Patterns, ARIA and more 
## Seth M Kane - Wednesday, March 16, 2016
[Source recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh5X64XMQYk)

**[Dennis]:** And we're live. And with that, I shall turn it over to Seth and his presentation.

**[Seth]:** So, again, my name is Seth Kane, technology lead at Critical Mass, I'm going to be talking about standards, design patterns and ARIA, and a little bit more. Just to give you a little preface to what this is going to be about because I'm very technical, it's not going to be about that. I want this presentation to be engaging, and thought provoking, so if there is any time you have a question or you want to provide some feedback or  comments or whatever, I strongly encourage you to raise your hand or interrupt but my goal for this is for you as individuals interested in accessibility to really start thinking about this rather than in your own discipline, but in a multi-discipline and more engaging effort to broaden your knowledge and your way to communicate the importance of this in various areas, so with that I will start with Standards. 

So, I don't know if you can read that in the back, I wasn't expecting a thirty-foot table but, basically standards is something set up and established by an authority as a rule for the measure of quantity, weight, extent, value and quality, and I emphasize quality I want us all to think about the beginning part of this presentation as more common elements in our real world, and how we can apply simple understandings of standards to accessibility, and other things as well. So, some examples. Standards can be found in almost every area of our daily lives. Some obvious ones, are like stop lights. Just about every stop light in the world works and looks and behaves in the exact same way. In some countries, they flip them left to right, but really its either top to bottom, left to right, and that's why the color isn't necessarily irrelevant, because the red is always either at the top or on the left and that's a standard that is being followed internationally.

Turning signal levers, I don't know if you have ever thought about it, but where is your turn signal lever in your car? Raise the hand that you use to turn your turn signals on or off. So most cars are on the outside of the steering wheel, unless it's an internationally, kind of type car so like, cars that might be sold in both markets, they might be changed, but that's another standard that usually all car manufacturers will follow for usability purposes and things like that. Nuts and bolts is an obvious one. Like lefty loosey, righty tighty. Now, there aren't very many examples out there of nuts and bolts that don't follow that standard so to speak and I would imagine that we could probably sit here for days and talk about various other ones but those are some common elements, some things that the rules are really never broken its just things that occur in our everyday lives. And with that note, are there web standards?

Well obviously, the answer is yes. Right? We all know that there is various ones and some might be known and some might not be known so just a quick reference like the W3C, that's basically the organization that sets all the browser standards some of the code standards and, that we work with every day. There's a less known one, I don't even know how they pronounce it, so I'm just going to call it the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group. They basically contribute to the W3C. They're like the workhorses of the W3C. They'll like, actually say "Hey, we want to do something different" and they'll start really investigating different types of things and determine if it can or can't be a standard and then present those ideas to the W3C. ISO, which is not really a web standard but its more of an internationally acclaimed, large, organizational standard if anybody has heard of ISO 9000 or 9001, some corporations, I'm guessing like United lives and breathes by that type of thing and those standards can be actually applied to web technologies and processes and things like that as well, the ADA, Ecma, Section 508 and there's probably a bizillon more and so forth.

So, let's ask why standards? I looked this up. And basically the dictionary definition more or less, or what I found was a common term for why ... to answer this question was, it provides a common language. Right? It sets expectations and enables compatibility. And the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of that rule of thumb is like electricity and outlets and things like that. Even though that each country they have different types of things but the basic common principles of the standards are, there's a positive, there's a negative, there's a ground all of those types of things. It never really deviates. And what that does, that provides the institutional of common language to know how to build something or know how to work something or how to integrate it with the most amount of compatibility.

Just imagine if we didn't have standards, what type of house you might live in, or what type of car you might drive in, or various other types of things. So, really, this is so important to understand, and how it can relate to what we do whether you're in content or user experience, or development, those standards should be treated as like the rules, right? And we shouldn't deviate from that. And if you were to take away anything from this presentation, it really is basically this. So with standards, becomes design patterns. Design patterns are reoccurring solutions that solve common design problems, right? So, go back to the electricity thing, like an outlet or whatever. Like a plug. Like, that follows a specific design pattern. I'm not talking about actually the plug itself, but, you plug it in, and it goes on, and you unplug it, and it turns off. Right? That's basically a foundational pattern, in the most simplest terms. Right? Things like, other real life examples would be like streets. Think about it. A street. Whether they're in a rural setting or an urban setting, they inherently are made and act and behave the same exact way. You know, there's left turns, right turns, straights, swervey roads but there's really no major deviations from a particular pattern or how to create and how to leverage and work in a street environment. Another one is buildings or houses. Houses and skyscrapers. They basically follow the same fundamental building process or design pattern. They first, a foundation, then they go to the frame, then they go to the roof, and they go from there. You can't build a house without starting at the foundation. It just won't last. So the pattern to follow is, you understand how it's built, how it's used, how it matches up with those standards that are incorporated into the design pattern and so forth.

This is my favorite one. And I"m hoping that with the next couple of slides, you'll all agree with me. But, doors, right? So there's many ways to get in and out of a building. But think about it. Ok, how do you use a door knob? It's the same way. It's either you turn it or you pull it up or down, you either push or pull to get in. There's different particular solutions to different particular types. But really, across the board, it's the same way. Every single type of door. Until, you get to, well, this is the door. So the standard door. So you would open this by either pushing or pulling, right? And then if there was maybe the bar across you know, horizontal, you'd push or pull or you'd turn a knob or whatever. But then came the idea of, how do we improve a particular design pattern like take a door. Is there a better way to do this. Is there a more efficient way to do this. So, someone came up with this idea. Right? So this is one of those revolving doors. And even though there are two design patterns, push pull or go around, this basically is a behavior that is disseminated out, you learn it, you train it, you know when you walk up to one of these things, do you ever question which way to go in? Or how to wait for the next person to come out? Because the pattern is a solution to the problem of getting in. Now this pattern is basically been enhanced from the other one. Some of the things that it does, maybe simpler to use. It's faster. You don't necessarily have roadblocks. It's also energy efficient. So there's other things that you may be solving for on this particular design pattern that might also cause problems. Can anyone think of a problem with these things? What?

**[Attendee]:** Wheelchair

**[Seth]:** Right, wheelchair, or you try to being your luggage through, it's difficult, right? So upon a design pattern as innovators of various industries and things we try to evolve and make those design patterns better, right? So what happens if we change the design pattern? Hopefully, everybody nods their head. Have you ever run into one of these? Especially at like IKEA. Right, that's the big one that I always run into. So this is the next evolution of the resolving door design pattern. But, have you ever walk through one of these and had a problem with how it works? You're shaking your head ... what's the problem with it?

**[Attendee]:** Well, uh, first of all, ... [mumble]

**[Seth]:** Right, so I have had a similar experience. I want to go through it faster, I've seen, a thousand times, people pushing on it. And all of a sudden it stops because it thinks its an emergency push that actually executes the emergency brake of it. So this design pattern was evolved but it might not have actually been thought through or it might not have been disseminated well enough to actually educate people to know how to use it. So they have to stick these little yellow things on there and say it's automatic. Don't push. Right?

So one could argue that, this is a new, innovative way to think, or do something. But maybe it didn't follow the native pattern of what it is that we are accustom to or what we want to do. Now I'm guessing over a period of time, these will become more popular, and people will learn how to use them, but think about what we do in our businesses and we try to do something new, or we're innovative or we change the pattern, you end up with something like this. And I guessing everybody has had a problem at one point or another with this particular design

**[Attendee]:** [mumble]

**[Seth]:** True. But on the other hand, people with luggage and wheelchairs could actually go through them, right? So, they might be solving one problem but creating another. And those are the types of thought provoking things that as innovators or user experience or content strategists or developers that you have to think through. And the best way to think through that is kind of like through, first the standards and then with patterns and accessibility?

Well, before we answer that, let's test ourselves. So, I've come up with some common things that I'm guessing we all do. That we can probably all answer. How do we open a new page on our computer like through our browser?

**[Attendee]:** Tab

**[Seth]:** What? Tab or ... Command T, that opens a tab. Command U or Control U, depending on whether you're on a Mac or PC. How do you quit a program? You know, Apple Q, or Windows Q or whatever. These are things that are very very common, you know, which button on a mouse do we use to select something? The left one, right? We know that. Even on our touch pad, it's a totally different design pattern but it uses the same basic standards to mimic a similar pattern. Right, how do we make something bold using the keyboard? Control B, right? So basically, our industry or computers itself have set forth some examples of common things that they've vetted through, that they know they work and they know that people know how to use it and you really don't have to train for it. You might actually like hover over the little B in Microsoft Word and it'll tell you how to do it. And then for the next time you'll know that it's going to come up, right? How do we navigate a web page? You know, like, this one, to me, is simple, but, do people that don't do what we do know this? They use the mouse, right? 
But how do you do it without the mouse? Do they know the standards, the base practices of navigating a website, you know, with it? You know, how do we use a module component? We're not going to answer that one because there is no in-depth example, but, like, think about the next time you design something or you build something. Is your module or component so intuitive that it follows the standards and design patterns, so they know right away how to use it? They don't even have to think about it. So, if we didn't follow standards and pattens, accessibility would be very difficult. I was kind of being PC with that. It would be, in my opinion, nearly impossible, right? So let's get some examples of how to make our work more accessible by following the standards and design patterns and here are some simple steps that we should follow. So, even though I am in technology, and most people in accessibility think that accessibility is a byproduct of the technology implementation portion of the project, but I believe it is the opposite. It actually should follow the same methodologies of building a house. It should start at the foundation, the blueprints, right? You have to vet to make sure that everything that is going to be proposed or that you are going to experience or interact with is accessible. I believe in asking the right questions, and the first place that I do it at is talk through the experience. So when I sit down with user experience folks, I basically ask them to explain the experience in layman's terms, not in technical, design details. It like, what do you want them to do? How do you want them to interact with it? An example would be, the user will move their mouse and hover over a call to action then they click the call to action, upon clicking the call to action, maybe a modal appears you know, the user will interact with that modal, right, and then when they decide to close the modal, they'll move on. So that's the interaction. But how does that actually get translated into what it is that we are doing? So those are the questions that I will engage with people to make sure that they're actually able to explain it to me in the most simplest terms. A modal or call to action is fairly simple, so let's just hypothetically talk about something like a new, you know, way to navigate, or add to cart, or shop or drag and drop, whatever it could be, can they explain the experience to me in the most simplest terms. Those will usually lead to things that tell us to design patterns and standards. Then I basically say, okay so now we've got the experience explained out, from more of a foundational point of view, I'll go to kind of like the decorating or the design elements. So I would likely sit down with the design team at that point, and  basically, I would ask them we expect designers to, you know, get creative, get like blue style, they want to be the most innovative they want to be the most creative folks. But it's important for them in particular to understand the feature or the intent, in addition to what it looks like. So my example is, this designer wants to use a switch, right, like an on off kind of like toggle you've seen them on mobile devices all the time, but they might not fully understand, both technically and experience what that switch actually is. Does everybody, can they visualize an on off like switch toggle like right? Most, I would say, probably on the record like 90 plus percent of the time, a switch is a boolean, right? In technical terms, an on or off, yes or no, true or false, right? Zero or one. And in that case, most times when you are switching, with those terms in play, you're actually using a form, or you're submitting data, a yes no answer response

So it's checkbox, it's a simple checkbox, right? So if the designer doesn't know the intent of it of how it is going to be implemented or how it's going to be interacted with, they may design an on off switch that might not work the same way a checkbox would work and that's a big problem. And we've probably seen it a thousand times. Then we come to the technical aspect of it. And it's like do we understand the implementation? So, developers can read documentation and they can learn all the W3C standards and things like that. But, it's often that the developer looks at like a set of wires or a Photoshop document and then just goes off and builds something, right, and understanding the design pattern to follow and the intent of the design element is the key to successfully executing it with accessibility in mind. So, take the switch, right?
So like how do they implement the design but as a radio or a checkbox? Or how do they create this new fancy like custom dropdown, like simple state selection UI, but they want it fancy with flags or with you know borders or whatever like we can implement that, but if it doesn't follow the standards and if it doesn't follow the design patterns, you won't be able to use it. And most actual backends won't be able to consume it. So it's really important for the developers to not just consume the documentation but to understand the intent, standards and the design patterns, because that's where they will know which tags to use, which ARIA, things like that and so forth. I wanted to show you some examples of where, I think, the industry at large has missed and has done well.

Ok, so this is a little video. So hopefully you can kind of see it. You'll see my mouse move. This is an example of a bad modal pattern. And just so I can throw them under the bus, this is jQuery modal dot com. So, number one in the search results, right? So what you'll see here is, I'm tabbing, so I'm using the keyboard to go between links and I click that call to action and its really hard to see because the screen is so dark, but when it opens again, I'm tabbing, and I'm actually tabbing the page links, not the modal links. So I can't actually interact with the modal at all. It's completely inaccessible. So it doesn't follow either the standards or the design patterns, which I'll get into a little bit later.

**[Attendee]:** Sorry I'm not clear.

**[Seth]:** Ok, I"m going to show you really quick. So I'm using a keyboard only to get to this. And I click enter. And it's really dark, but what you'll see is once the modal opens,  you'll see that it's moving in the background. But I'm not able to interact with the components within the modal, like I can't actually click the close button and I can't click the blue call-to-action inside the modal, the close. So, making that modal...

**[Attendee]:** keyboard

**[Seth]:** Correct  

**[Attendee]:** OK. So someone with a visual disability in particular needs to use a keyboard but someone, let's say, with Parkinson's, they may not be using a mouse because of you know, motor disabilities and they'll force themselves, more structurally, to use the keyboard. So, this particular modal, if you implemented this on your website, it would be completely unaccessible to people with disabilities. On the other hand, I found a good one, which believe it or not is Bootstrap, so, this is the call to action, and you'll notice now i'm actually interacting with the element in the model now can you see I'm tabbing the same type of thing but once I'm open I'm now forced inside the model and I have to make a decision to either act on it or close it so this is a actual good design path so basically  you tab to the call to action, you click or enter to open it you focus on the model which is the blue ring around the white box you click tab, your tab lock aside and you can either close the model or return to your call to action. That's the other key feature to, is when you close it, you return back to where you came from unrecognisable chatter ... a good design pattern with regards to a modal. Ok.

So let's look at some , you know, some more examples. So what I want to do here quickly if this works is I'm gonna switch to my browser,  which I did. Ok 

**[Dennis]:** Oh, That part is not straight

**[Seth]:** Ohhhh, really, even if I don't, if I share the hangout? Where's my hangout? Maybe I need to share ...

**[Dennis]:** Yeah, again I think ... Ok, but I'm gonna to move this over so you don't see it twice. So, this is an example of actually, the W3C, they link to this ... but this is like a tooltip so let me go back here really quickly. So a tool tip, so according to ... Alright, maybe I won't change ... change screens ... technical difficulties ... Ok, well, this is the wrong screen but that's alright, that's ok well we'll stick with this for now.

**[Dennis]:** well, yeah, unfortunately I think it's looping on to itself

**[Seth]:** Yeah,  that's a issue with Hangout. Ok. Well now you see my notes but that's ok ...

**[Dennis]:** Those are not shared, your site notes.

**[Seth]:** right

**[Dennis]** Oh here they are but not ...

**[Seth]:** Right. Ok, so basically this is ... according to the W3C, at the bottom here I linked to it and this particular, you know, example is with, you know, tooltips so a tooltip is like if you hover on something you get a real dialog of sorts, so a popup that displays a description for an element when the user passes over or rests on the element, supplements to a normal tooltip, blah blah blah ... but here's the key, right, so the triggering element to which the tooltip is attached link should never actually lose input or focus. So accordingly to the W3C for a tooltip there's a rule to be followed. Right? And the next one is if the tooltip is invoked when the trigger element gets focused then it should be dismissed when it no longer has focus. So those are things that user experienced people need to know and developers need to know when their actually like saying hey, this is what it is that I'm going to represent, so, let me try and switch here.

I know I might have to go back ... hold on ... you can see that, now I'm going to become an expert at this soon

**[Dennis]:** [Laugh]

**[Seth]:** You think ... if I can find my hangout ... thats cool. I think ... two screens ... Ok, this will help. This is was actually my intention on how I would fill up time ...

**[Dennis]:** [Laugh] ... good job ...

**[Seth]:** Ok, so we're sharing this right? Ok, so everybody can see. So this is an example of a tooltip. So I mouse over this field and it says oh your first name is optional and I moused over another field, you know, your last name is optional and it disappears. If I'm in the box it stays there, if I leave the box technically, oh my mouse is still there. So when I switch between these, these tooltips are showing and hiding according to the spec. So this is key so when someone goes and reinvents the wheel or thinks of another way to do it the best place for everybody to start is is back at the design pattern and the standards. Ok, let me show you one more so I don't have to keep going back and forth between things so here is another one on Bootstrap right so if I hover it shows up on the left if I hover it shows up on the right you know whatever that with the mouse. If I get to this, on it here, eventually you'll see I'm tabbing, I'm not using my mouse and hopefully somewhere down here is a tooltip ... this is a whole different discussion to have.

Let's see here ... So I should follow the thing.  Oh, here we go. So you'l see that I've tabbed on the tooltip on the right and I've tabbed that I'm on the top, the bottom, the top, left, and if I go through it shows a lot it's a perfect example of following spec so there's rules to be, you know, followed and so forth. Let me show one more. Another tool tip, right so if I come down to here ... so it's like this guy right? So if I tap to these guys, it shows me, if I tap out, goes to the next one and so forth, so again a simple example of following the spec.

Let's go back ... So were talking about like the ability to interact with it right now, but technically making it accessible for screen readers is a whole separate step so one thing I tell the people that I am auditing or that I say "Hey, is this accessible or not?" the number one thing I say is "go use your keyboard." If you can't interact with it with the keyboard, I can pretty much guarantee you're not going to be able to use it with a screen reader. So foundation again, if you can't use it with a keyboard you're likely not going to be able to use it with a screenreader. If you can use it with your keyboard you got to go to the next level kind of like a video game. Which I think is over here ...

**[Attendee]:**  So, the process of, it's keyboard accessible, means the screen reader won't get stuck inside the modal. But, it still doesn't mean the modal is usable.

**[Seth]:** So are you talking about the tool tip or the modal? I just want to make sure we're talking about the same thing. So in this case the tooltip ... so the question was again just repeat it so ...

**[Attendee]:** So if not getting through it on a keyboard is not a problem ...

**[Seth]:** Not necessarily, because ... think about it from let's say someone that's forced to use a keyboard, but isn't visually impaired they are going to use the keyboard to navigate to something and they are going to want to know what that acronym is or whatever it is at the tooltip is and because they can't use the mouse they need to have that thing be visible. So that information is pertinent enough for them to access.

**[Attendee]:** So, this would be ... of keyboard, ah ...

**[Seth]:** Well, that's the baseline. So then you take it to the next level and someone is totally blind, what you would do
which is getting a little deeper into the later parts of the presentation is, you can add extra elements like ARIA that will make it ... the information, the supplemental information available verbally for auditory, right so they will never see the tooltip but they know that when they tap to it, it says "ABC has tooltip" and it will say "ABC is a XYZ" or whatever, it will announce to them whatever you programmatically want to tell them.

**[Attendee]:**  I just didn't know, I never tried it.

**[Seth]:** Makes perfect sense. Ok, so that was a tool tip. One more, ok  this is my favorite one. There's too much to read through here, but a date picker, right, I'm not going to through you under the bus, but I'm going to use one of your competitors. Ok, so a date picker is, you have a field, right and it says "when do you wana leave" or "what's your birthday" or whatever and you tab into it and it says, oh this big magical popup says, with a calendar looking thing, right? Ok, so that is what a date picker is. And this goes into significant detail of what the spec and what the standards are, of how that date picker should or shouldn't work and to give you an idea, I needed two pages plus. I didn't even go down that. I'll read a couple of these as an example, so you have a good understanding. So basically, keyboard navagation on days that are not included on the currently displayed month should move to the month automatically and lead to the date in the next previous month. So basically when you focus in, the highlight of the component should go to today. Then there's like tab, like other widgets, the date picker receives focus by tabbing in, once focus is received, focus is repositioned on today's date in the grid, on the day of the week a second tab will take the user out of the date picker wizard focusing initially is placed on today's date so most date pickers don't follow that. I'll show you that when you tab and it focuses the date picker, if you hit tab again it might actually start tabbing through the dates which means you can never get out of it.

So using something like shift tab reverses the direction of the tab focus or up and down arrows that allows you to actually pick supplemental dates  ... we'll get into that and things like that so there's a really really long list and I put down here which you can't see in the presentation a link to the spec that is overwhelming and I guarantee you that those UX people that are envisioning the next best date picker which most airlines are usually trying to do because they want an easier hotels in particular, I've gone through these conversations they wana make it simple and intuitive in check in check out  ya know departure return they want it really cool and really innovative but there never following the specs here so I can't find a single one that follows the spec and I looked but I did however, find some that do let's go show what let's get outa here and go back to my little example which I'm becoming expert at this now, come on

Ok, I want share my screen ... I'm not sharing

Let's go to this one, this fantastic one distributed by the largest JavaScript framework known to man basically. Ok, everybody starts here so I'm going to show you what it looks like with a mouse first so I enter in here and I get this fancy little date thing, I can go back and forth and you know I can pick the seventeenth and I can do this and all that kinda stuff, right? But lets try to do it with a mouse ok I mean with a keyboard I hit tab ok and tab number one but it immediately closes. I hit tab ok and tab number one but it immediately closes. Ok so I hit tab, I can't use it. I hit the arrows, I'm hitting the arrows, and all I am doing is cycling through you know the dates. The actual date picker module is not accessible. 

Should we try something else? Shift Enter? Ok, I'm just winging it with you.

Shift Enter. Ok.

One could argue, and this is where the debates will typically happen, is that, does the actual picker itself need to be made accessible? One could argue that I could just type my date. I'm not blocked by doing this with the keyboard. One one, two thousand twenty, right? I didn't get the date picker, I was able to enter my date but I'm not getting the same experience, so to speak. So that's where the debate will likely come in. But, if you are going to try to create an inclusive design, one for all and all for one, you would likely want the date picker to be available to people with certain disabilities, they can fast and easily use it just like if I were to use a mouse. Bad example. Let's go to a good one.

Let's go to ... this one is okay. So this is pickadate, so I found a different plug-in. So this one looks really cool, right? And I can click these arrows and I can pick a date I can even go to today and I can clear my entry. All that kind of stuff. A great user experience so to speak, I'm not going to go too much into detail. But for a mouse user, its fantastic, right? If I'm using it on a keyboard, I can actually use this. It doesn't follow the spec, because I can't do things like, you know, Shift-Enter, I don't have these things memorized, like go from today's date from a previous month but I can at least interact and go and use it. So it is a much better following practice of both the standards and the design spec. One more here ... And this is where I apologize to Dennis

**[Dennis]:** You're right. You're right

**[Seth]:** So, I'm ... if you guys want to see some really good accessibility, like, I just started really nit-picking this site, it's very good, and it's getting even better, and I didn't realize there was a standard or a date timeline for all the airlines. And now it makes perfect sense to me. Why this is so good. Because I would have expected this to be bad. But, so date picker. So you get this cool thing, it's awesome, it shows me two months at a time and I can go forward, I can go back with a mouse and it shows me really, visually how awesome this this is. If I use it with a mouse, I mean a keyboard ... I'll get into the bottom section of this in a little bit. But, I can actually, if I can remember, I don't remember the controls. So there, I'm going. So I can go forward, I can go down, I can actually go month to month if I click there, right. All of these kind of things. This is impressive. Ok, and there are actually, if we reviewed those design patterns, according to ARIA all of those, or most of them are pretty available. The other thing that I will highlight at the bottom, is really impressive. So let me explain this quickly, and then I'll get into it in more detail.

Notice how when I use my mouse, you don't see that bottom. But when I use my keyboard, I do. That's awesome and I'll explain why in a little bit. Ok, so let me go back to this guy. 

I don't have much more. I do not have much more.

Ok, so, we couldn't find the specs, so now let's talk about ARIA. Right, so this is like the technical thing that some of you may or may not be aware of. ARIA is the Accessible Rich Internet Applications suite, defines a way to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with the dynamic content and advance users, interface controls, development with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript and related technologies. So this is basically like a secondary language to what we do, that helps code talk to assistive technologies, and assistive technologies to talk to code. So all of those design patterns basically got augmented and got enhanced with ARIA. So, understanding some basics, this is a little more technical, so let me know if you have any questions.

Sight and mobility-impaired users must be able to quickly access a list of landmarks for a web page that they use. So basically think of it like a table of contents, so we want to define using landmarks. Code, on the page, that tells a user with various disabilities that there's a navigation, there's a side navigation, there's a search, there's content, you want to be explicit so they can, you know, go to those areas with ease. Remember those examples with tabbing tabbing tabbing tabbing, and trying to get to something? This prevents that because they can use assistive technology to access shortcuts to skip the navigation, we've all heard that, right?

Skip to navigation when you first tab? This eliminates that. You don't have to add some extra visual and contextual, you can just basically add some code and they automatically add this glorious table of contents. Roles. So, once you get landmarks, then you might want to specify each particular thing.

What is this? So like, it's a banner, right? It's a main section, it's a navigation. It's a search. Imagine you trying to execute a specific task, and there's a lot of content on that page. This is a way for you to quickly access something without question of what it is. And this is something that really is very foundational. This takes a developer no effort whatsoever to implement. It just takes him to do it. But there's no advanced learnings. Just understanding what is available and going from there.

And then we get into a little more advanced stuff. So States and Properties. And this is where ARIA kicks in. So this is, prior to ARIA, there was no consistent, bidirectional, cross-browser implementation between assistive technologies and applications to communicate. So like for instance, take my on off switch, right? I can click it or I can tab it, bit there was no way for a custom built switch to communicate with an assistive technology. Because there's that no standard, right? We are losing the communication gap. So ARIA allows us to do things like expanded or checked or selected or labelledby, there's a lot of that. So like take a toggle, right. Open, close. Well, it is expanded. Or it is not expanded. It's checked, or it's not checked.

We can build very creative experiences and visual designs now, and use ARIA to bridge the communication gap between those technologies. There's so much to go into that I couldn't do it here. But to give you an example of where it can be applied is like, so take ARIA for content strategists. One of the common things they always complain about is "click here" or "explore" or, they want to be very simple and plain in their nomenclature of buttons in particular. So, they can add contextual elements that are not visually there, but are to the assistive technologies using labelledby or describedby. Or they can actually announce what's actually happened.

So, it's hard to see, but in the case of Southwest, when I actually focus in to the box this black area here is what the screen reader is actually reading. Ok, so it's reading, content selected, date depart, date depart and formats mm dd valid dates for March fourth and November fourth, keyboard instructions up down arrow access the widget shift right, I mean like, imagine coming to this for the very first time and not having that instruction there would be no way for you to know how to use that unless you were following the design pattern to spec. Which we've all clearly noticed it's very hard to do. So, content strategists can add contextual information to help for accessibility. So this is an example of where you can go the extra mile if the people are thinking about the intent. 

Another one is for UX folks. So, Apple is a great example. They kill it when is comes to accessibility. So, what I'm doing is I'm using the search box, using the keyboard. And the things that I've noticed is, they're using ARIA autocomplete to tell the user that while you start typing your search phrase, that basically a list of things are autocompleting so, you'll see it's giving me hints. It's telling me that that's actually happening. ARIA has popup. It told me that its popping up with a new feature or so fourth. So these are the things that the developers can implement without any question. But it's the user experience people, to go back to that intent, how do I want them to use it? How do I want them to interact with it? If they don't tell the developer that the developers won't necessarily know what ARIA to actually use, okay?

This is for the geeks in the room. The bad news for you front-end web developers is, for you to do this right, developers not only need to utilize the appropriate ARIA roles, states and properties, they also have to leverage and use JavaScript to help manage the constant flux of content, interactions and states. Some of the things to think about while leveraging all the JavaScript are that sites using JavaScript typically will be fully accessible. There's been a lot of data to show that people, even with people with assistive technologies they don't disable JavaScript anymore. So all of the screen readers and other assistive technologies are being incorporated with JavaScript enabled, through ARIA and following those specs and standards. Ensure that your scripts are both mouse and keyboard enabled. A typical one is you'll use a click handler. Well, a click handler isn't focus, right? It's not keyboard. It's click. Things like that. You have to actually think about all the extra JavaScript that you'll have to work with especially, I think I heard someone talk about Ember. You know, like if you're talking about single page application that is constantly changing in its state, This is going to be a lot of work. Leverage dependent and independant event triggers.

This is relatively new actually, or at least I thought is was. You can track if it's a click or keyboard event. So go back to that Southwest example. They didn't show the additional help at the bottom if I used my mouse. But if I used my keyboard, it added actual content and context to the screen. So they're using independent and dependent triggers to differentiate between mouse and keyboard. So they're going the extra mile, with that type of philosophy. Managing focus and refocus, so like, a good example is, we always thinking about going somewhere, but if they close it or if they do a negative action, does it take them back to where they were. Like one thing I often find is like, when I use a table of contents if I click the table of contents, and I get sent down to the bottom of the page, but what happens when I want to get back? There's no way back. You have to tab shift all the way through every single link to get back. There should be potentially a way to track where you came from and where you might want to go back. Things like that.

And then the biggest one is for you developers, read and follow the design patterns. I cannot emphasize that enough. There are, there's so much but that really the only way to make the assistive technologies to be able to communicate to the browser is through the standards. Some don't follow them, some do but at least we can go with the baseline. So, here's an example of all of the design patterns that are already specified. Accordions, alert boxes, dialogs, autocomplete, buttons, checkboxes, comboboxes, date pickers, modals, drag and drop, grid, I mean, I'm guessing there might be a small percentage of user experiences out there that comes up wth something brand new. But you can't, I would be surprised if you can't correlate it back to this.

So like, take an accordion. Oh, not an accordion, a carousel. There's no carousel in this. So let's think about it, break it apart. Buttons, content, links. Each little piece of the carousel can be broken up into a standard. And that's really where you want to focus on both, I would say if you are a UX person, this is a great place to start building that next best experience but following the standard. Take the turnstyle door, right? If you follow these, it'll be more easy to recognize, know how it works, you won't be pushing it, you won't be bouncing it because it's going to slow or whatever may be, and then from a developers point of view, this is the place where you really need to make sure, because if you don't follow these at least the majority of the way through, screen readers in particular won't be accessible. 

And that concludes the presentation. Thank you.

**[Applause]**

**[Dennis]:** Any questions...

**[Steve]:** So, how does this impact mobile phones?

**[Seth]:** So, it impacts nearly one to one. If you are talking about native application, so like your Facebook app, there's a lot more nuance and a lot more spec out there that hasn't been defined. But I would say that if you are talking mobile web, so like responsive design, like, screen readers on mobile phones are following the same standards as desktops are. And the design pattern, if you think about the analogy of roads or outlooks or whatever, it's the same thing, right, a switch is a switch, a carousel is a carousel, whether it is in a native app or in a web page, it's the same intuitive thing. The only thing that is different is how you interact with it. So if you're able-bodied, you might use swipe, right? For something, or touch, or tap. If you're not, you use a screen reader that basically has to intuitively, you know, communicate to whatever it is that it wants to do, and what it should be doing. So, if you have an iPhone, try your VoiceOver on it. It's awesome. It does it very well. And you'll find that the sites or the apps that are following most of the patterns are the ones you can actually use. So I would say that in most cases, it's a one to one.

**[Steve]:** Great. And then the second question, most of these things are JavaScript?

**[Seth]:** No, so, most, so the screen where I had landmarks, roles and then states and properties, landmarks and roles are pure HTML. They are just straight-up HTML. There are no ifs, ands or buts. The state changing, when you need to interact with it on a dynamic element so, does everybody understand what stateless or state means? It means that it is either ... like static or it can be a constant across ... if it doesn't have a state, that it can change, you have to track that through JavaScript. So there are instances of sites out there that don't really leverage a lot of dynamically changing components and elements that you can make purely accessible, which is some basic ARIA tags, roles and landmarks.

**[Attendee]:** I have a question

**[Seth]:** Sure.

**[Attendee]:** So I read somewhere where ARIA was ... and a lot of the default HTML5 elements and landmarks actually have the ARIA ...  within them.

**[Seth]:** Correct.

**[Attendee]:** So would it be better to just try to ...I don't know, not be so redundant ...

**[Seth]:** Correct. So in the absence of, if I were to use the nav tag, which is navigation, you wouldn't need to add role navigation to it. You would not need to do that. But in the instance of, you know, progressive enhancement and graceful degradation, when you have to accommodate a non-HTML5 browser, you then need to a shim it, if no one knows what that is, I will explain later, but be basically, add the role. That's usually what shimming will do. But, yes, generally speaking, you don't need to over tag, and the way to learn more about that is what I do a lot now, which is, a lot quicker and a lot easier is to use a fiddle, like a js fiddle or like a codepen I'll stick one tiny tag in that fiddle and I'll open up my screen reader rather than going through the whole page and figuring out the page, I will go component and elements alone and hear it and learn from it and see if it actually works. It's an extra step, it's kind of a poc, a proof of concept. So, thats how I'll do that. You could go in, type a tag and test it and be like "ok, well, maybe that's not intuitive enough,
I'm going to add something else."

**[Dennis]:** We actually did something similar, we've had an ongoing debate between aria-label, aria-labelledby and aria-describedby. We had one of our folks in requirements saying aria-labelledby and then the text they want to appear. For any of you who do not know, aria-labelledby and describedby, they typically point to an ID, which has the textual content that is describing the label. Aria-label actually contains the text string that is used as the label. But we ... I knew that as being the fact, but the UX person that I'm collaborated with kept on saying aria-describedby and then the text. So I literally created just a flat, HTML file with every variation of these three ARIAs used, and then we just listened to it in two different screen readers and said done. And I think that's really what you have to do with ARIA. In our initial requirements, the requirements folks, next to every link, would say role equals link. And I'm like ... all that extra work.

**[Seth]:** Yeah, there's intent for each of them. And understanding the intent of them could sometimes be ambiguous. But like, just like, for front-end developers, when do you use an ID and when do you use a class or when do you use a data selector, all of these type of things come into the discussion. There is original intent behind those attributes and parameters. And if you stick to the original intent, you'll likely succeed more across a wider range than if you change it, like for instance, like I could not use any class or ID on any div or any element ever, right? And I could use data selectors. I could manipulate it and manage the page any way I wanted to. It's possible. Should you? No. So you want to try and research back to the intent of the littlest nuance to ensure that the widest range of things are actually working. So like labelledby would widely be used for a one to many relationship. So you have one description like "this link opens in a new window" but you have ten links on the page. So those ten links will have labelledby and that one ID like Dennis said, and your leveraging a better experience and a better codebase to do it as well.

**[Attendee]:** How different would you say the experience is between different screen readers?

**[Seth]:** I'm glad you asked. I would say that it is an exact, same paradigm as between Safari, Firefox, Mozilla, IE, Chrome. It is just a different browser. I mean, essentially what it is. NVDA doesn't do exactly what JAWS does, JAWS doesn't do what VoiceOver does. They're all trying to follow the specs but they all behave differently.

**[Dennis]:** One thing I'll say about that, just from an experience within the last six to eight months is it's also a difference between platforms ... JAWS, handle things in a similar manner. JAWS is more robust than NVDA. Safari which is on a different platform, reads the DOM in a different manner. Therefore, certain things that may work in JAWS and NVDA does not seem to work in Safari. It doesn't mean that Safari is broken, it just that it does it differently. From my experience, Safari and VoiceOver are the most strict combination that you can use. So if you don't know if something works or not, try it in Safari and VoiceOver first, then test on the Windows platform.

**[Seth]:** Right, and it's also a paradigm between which screen reader or assistive technology you are using and which browser you are using.

**[Dennis]:** Don't use Chrome.

**[Seth]:** Right? So for instance, you're using VoiceOver and you're using Chrome, it won't work as well if you're using VoiceOver with Safari. Or if you're using JAWS with Firefox versus JAWS with IE.

**[Attendee]** [Unrecognizable]

**[Dennis]:** So, two things. They're not telling us.

**[Laughter]**

**[Dennis]:** So two things. One, WebAim, which is a website, they have an annual screen reader survey. Check out the survey, the last one was last July, they'll likely be putting out another one soon. And they tell you the combinations of browser and screen reader, and it actually changed big time last year because of the folks that run Windows Eyes, they actually announced to their users that there was a survey going on and NVDA dropped clear to second to last place and Windows Eyes was second to JAWS. But you'll get a feel for how actually screen reader users are using the tools, with which browsers and such, that's a great resource. Now, how are the airlines handling it?

**[Attendee]:** Somebody is going to come back and judge you, right?

**[Dennis]:** Yes, and that is the users. So, it's been an emotional roller coaster the last year because the DOT is not telling us what their going to do. First, we thought they were going to hire auditors. What's going to happen is, when users find an issue, they won't come to us, they'll go to the DOT. The DOT will file a complaint with us, we have however long, we don't even know how long the grace period is but we will have, however many weeks to fix that particular problem, or else we will be fined $27,000 dollars per instance per day.

**[Seth]:** The thing to keep in mind, and I'll kind of go back to the original question so A: if you are in the position to make a choice of what requirements you have just like any sort of requirements, you follow the numbers. So like JAWS is 75% of the screen reader market. So by using ChromeVox, which is a good example, it's like zero percent. So it's a testing tool.

**[Dennis]:** Yeah, it's a testing tool, we actually thought it would be great for our developers, because it's like handy. Experience has told us that it works completely differently as well as Chrome in general works differently with any screen reader. We're heavy Chrome users for development, but when it comes time to using a screen reader, open up Firefox and NVDA or IE and JAWS.

**[Seth]:** Just like you would do in a normal QA cycle, so at Critical Mass, we test every browser that meets our client's or the industry's requirements. So, when it comes down to it, we can't guarantee that it'll work in every single browser and every single device or every single orientation, it's not possible. But we can do our best. And our best, the easiest way to achieve the best, is to follow the specs. And I will say that, in my experience, JAWS and VoiceOver and NVDA, they all behave very very similar from a code perspective, you might just need to know the nuances of how to access that. Like, as a tester. So, your testers might actually not know how to use the devices or the assistive technology well enough, and they'll get false positives. So just like I did an example, I pulled up Southwest, I couldn't figure it out, I said ok, that's how. It was eventually accessible, once I remembered the right types of things to do. So your testers have to really know the devices that they're using to test on. It's like, a mobile phone or a desktop, you test differently from a mobile phone to a desktop, right? You test differently from NVDA to JAWS, JAWS to VoiceOver. So if you're doing the full gamut, it's part of the biz, so to speak.

**[Attendee]:** Dennis, the Feds, there's no way the Feds will ...

**[Seth]:** There's a question back over here.

**[Attendee]:** ...

**[Seth]:** So yes. So that is the W3C created WCAG 2.0, which is relatively recent, and then there's three levels, within that, so that's the standards that basically both the browsers are following and the assistive technologies are trying to mimic towards, but as we all know, browsers and companies and businesses like to make their own nuances and they don't always follow the standards, right? And that's why we have kit CSS, we have Mozilla, hyphen Mozilla because they wanted to do something before the standard was finished or before there was a standard. So every browser and every assistive technology, they all try and follow a certain set of rules, but this is not a perfect utopia. So that rarely ever happens.

**[Dennis]:** We have time for one more question.

**[Attendee]:** ...

**[Dennis]:** So, that ... I believe that was started by Stephen Faulkner who contributes to the W3C spec for ARIA. But also on WebAim.org their forum, let's put it this way, I joined the International Association of Accessibility Professionals last year primarily for the forums. I did not renew, because WebAim, and their forums, which are free, are almost richer for my particular needs. It's a little antiquated, because it's driven by email. But if you want to learn like ...I started a thread, however many months ago, a button versus a link. And actually, the information I was receiving, which was from like Steven Faulkner from the W3C and Leonie Watson and such, they were contradicting what the advice we were being given by an agency, and that was helpful because I actually have a high level of respect for these particular people. They basically said, code to spec, let the assistive technology catch up, which sounds like IE, so. It's just history repeating itself.

Well, once again, Seth, thank you so much.

**[Applause]**

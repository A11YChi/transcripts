# Standards, Design Patterns, ARIA and more 
## Seth M Kane - Wednesday, March 16, 2016
[Source recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh5X64XMQYk)

**[Dennis]:** And we're live. And with that, I shall turn it over to Seth and his presentation.

**[Seth]:** So, again, my name is Seth Kane, technology lead at Critical Mass, I'm going to be talking about standards, design patterns and ARIA, and a little bit more. Just to give you a little preface to what this is going to be about because I'm very technical, it's not going to be about that. I want this presentation to be engaging, and thought provoking, so if there is any time you have a question or you want to provide some feedback or  comments or whatever, I strongly encourage you to raise your hand or interrupt but my goal for this is for you as individuals interested in accessibility to really start thinking about this rather than in your own discipline, but in a multi-discipline and more engaging effort to broaden your knowledge and your way to communicate the importance of this in various areas, so with that I will start with Standards. 

So, I don't know if you can read that in the back, I wasn't expecting a thirty-foot table but, basically standards is something set up and established by an authority as a rule for the measure of quantity, weight, extent, value and quality, and I emphasize quality I want us all to think about the beginning part of this presentation as more common elements in our real world, and how we can apply simple understandings of standards to accessibility, and other things as well. So, some examples. Standards can be found in almost every area of our daily lives. Some obvious ones, are like stop lights. Just about every stop light in the world works and looks and behaves in the exact same way. In some countries, they flip them left to right, but really its either top to bottom, left to right, and that's why the color isn't necessarily irrelevant, because the red is always either at the top or on the left and that's a standard that is being followed internationally.

Turning signal levers, I don't know if you have ever thought about it, but where is your turn signal lever in your car? Raise the hand that you use to turn your turn signals on or off. So most cars are on the outside of the steering wheel, unless it's an internationally, kind of type car so like, cars that might be sold in both markets, they might be changed, but that's another standard that usually all car manufacturers will follow for usability purposes and things like that. Nuts and bolts is an obvious one. Like lefty loosey, righty tighty. Now, there aren't very many examples out there of nuts and bolts that don't follow that standard so to speak and I would imagine that we could probably sit here for days and talk about various other ones but those are some common elements, some things that the rules are really never broken its just things that occur in our everyday lives. And with that note, are there web standards?

Well obviously, the answer is yes. Right? We all know that there is various ones and some might be known and some might not be known so just a quick reference like the W3C, that's basically the organization that sets all the browser standards some of the code standards and, that we work with every day. There's a less known one, I don't even know how they pronounce it, so I'm just going to call it the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group. They basically contribute to the W3C. They're like the workhorses of the W3C. They'll like, actually say "Hey, we want to do something different" and they'll start really investigating different types of things and determine if it can or can't be a standard and then present those ideas to the W3C. ISO, which is not really a web standard but its more of an internationally acclaimed, large, organizational standard if anybody has heard of ISO 9000 or 9001, some corporations, I'm guessing like United lives and breathes by that type of thing and those standards can be actually applied to web technologies and processes and things like that as well, the ADA, Ecma, Section 508 and there's probably a bizillon more and so forth.

So, let's ask why standards? I looked this up. And basically the dictionary definition more or less, or what I found was a common term for why ... to answer this question was, it provides a common language. Right? It sets expectations and enables compatibility. And the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of that rule of thumb is like electricity and outlets and things like that. Even though that each country they have different types of things but the basic common principles of the standards are, there's a positive, there's a negative, there's a ground all of those types of things. It never really deviates. And what that does, that provides the institutional of common language to know how to build something or know how to work something or how to integrate it with the most amount of compatibility.

Just imagine if we didn't have standards, what type of house you might live in, or what type of car you might drive in, or various other types of things. So, really, this is so important to understand, and how it can relate to what we do whether you're in content or user experience, or development, those standards should be treated as like the rules, right? And we shouldn't deviate from that. And if you were to take away anything from this presentation, it really is basically this. So with standards, becomes design patterns. Design patterns are reoccurring solutions that solve common design problems, right? So, go back to the electricity thing, like an outlet or whatever. Like a plug. Like, that follows a specific design pattern. I'm not talking about actually the plug itself, but, you plug it in, and it goes on, and you unplug it, and it turns off. Right? That's basically a foundational pattern, in the most simplest terms. Right? Things like, other real life examples would be like streets. Think about it. A street. Whether they're in a rural setting or an urban setting, they inherently are made and act and behave the same exact way. You know, there's left turns, right turns, straights, swervey roads but there's really no major deviations from a particular pattern or how to create and how to leverage and work in a street environment. Another one is buildings or houses. Houses and skyscrapers. They basically follow the same fundamental building process or design pattern. They first, a foundation, then they go to the frame, then they go to the roof, and they go from there. You can't build a house without starting at the foundation. It just won't last. So the pattern to follow is, you understand how it's built, how it's used, how it matches up with those standards that are incorporated into the design pattern and so forth.

This is my favorite one. And I"m hoping that with the next couple of slides, you'll all agree with me. But, doors, right? So there's many ways to get in and out of a building. But think about it. Ok, how do you use a door knob? It's the same way. It's either you turn it or you pull it up or down, you either push or pull to get in. There's different particular solutions to different particular types. But really, across the board, it's the same way. Every single type of door. Until, you get to, well, this is the door. So the standard door. So you would open this by either pushing or pulling, right? And then if there was maybe the bar across you know, horizontal, you'd push or pull or you'd turn a knob or whatever. But then came the idea of, how do we improve a particular design pattern like take a door. Is there a better way to do this. Is there a more efficient way to do this. So, someone came up with this idea. Right? So this is one of those revolving doors. And even though there are two design patterns, push pull or go around, this basically is a behavior that is disseminated out, you learn it, you train it, you know when you walk up to one of these things, do you ever question which way to go in? Or how to wait for the next person to come out? Because the pattern is a solution to the problem of getting in. Now this pattern is basically been enhanced from the other one. Some of the things that it does, maybe simpler to use. It's faster. You don't necessarily have roadblocks. It's also energy efficient. So there's other things that you may be solving for on this particular design pattern that might also cause problems. Can anyone think of a problem with these things? What?

**[Attendee]:** Wheelchair

**[Seth]:** Right, wheelchair, or you try to being your luggage through, it's difficult, right? So upon a design pattern as innovators of various industries and things we try to evolve and make those design patterns better, right? So what happens if we change the design pattern? Hopefully, everybody nods their head. Have you ever run into one of these? Especially at like IKEA. Right, that's the big one that I always run into. So this is the next evolution of the resolving door design pattern. But, have you ever walk through one of these and had a problem with how it works? You're shaking your head ... what's the problem with it?

**[Attendee]:** Well, uh, first of all, ... [mumble]

**[Seth]:** Right, so I have had a similar experience. I want to go through it faster, I've seen, a thousand times, people pushing on it. And all of a sudden it stops because it thinks its an emergency push that actually executes the emergency brake of it. So this design pattern was evolved but it might not have actually been thought through or it might not have been disseminated well enough to actually educate people to know how to use it. So they have to stick these little yellow things on there and say it's automatic. Don't push. Right?

So one could argue that, this is a new, innovative way to think, or do something. But maybe it didn't follow the native pattern of what it is that we are accustom to or what we want to do. Now I'm guessing over a period of time, these will become more popular, and people will learn how to use them, but think about what we do in our businesses and we try to do something new, or we're innovative or we change the pattern, you end up with something like this. And I guessing everybody has had a problem at one point or another with this particular design

**[Attendee]:** [mumble]

**[Seth]:** True. But on the other hand, people with luggage and wheelchairs could actually go through them, right? So, they might be solving one problem but creating another. And those are the types of thought provoking things that as innovators or user experience or content strategists or developers that you have to think through. And the best way to think through that is kind of like through, first the standards and then with patterns and accessibility?

Well, before we answer that, let's test ourselves. So, I've come up with some common things that I'm guessing we all do. That we can probably all answer. How do we open a new page on our computer like through our browser?

**[Attendee]:** Tab

**[Seth]:** What? Tab or ... Command T, that opens a tab. Command U or Control U, depending on whether you're on a Mac or PC. How do you quit a program? You know, Apple Q, or Windows Q or whatever. These are things that are very very common, you know, which button on a mouse do we use to select something? The left one, right? We know that. Even on our touch pad, it's a totally different design pattern but it uses the same basic standards to mimic a similar pattern. Right, how do we make something bold using the keyboard? Control B, right? So basically, our industry or computers itself have set forth some examples of common things that they've vetted through, that they know they work and they know that people know how to use it and you really don't have to train for it. You might actually like hover over the little B in Microsoft Word and it'll tell you how to do it. And then for the next time you'll know that it's going to come up, right? How do we navigate a web page? You know, like, this one, to me, is simple, but, do people that don't do what we do know this? They use the mouse, right? 
But how do you do it without the mouse? Do they know the standards, the base practices of navigating a website, you know, with it? You know, how do we use a module component? We're not going to answer that one because there is no in-depth example, but, like, think about the next time you design something or you build something. Is your module or component so intuitive that it follows the standards and design patterns, so they know right away how to use it? They don't even have to think about it. So, if we didn't follow standards and pattens, accessibility would be very difficult. I was kind of being PC with that. It would be, in my opinion, nearly impossible, right? So let's get some examples of how to make our work more accessible by following the standards and design patterns and here are some simple steps that we should follow. So, even though I am in technology, and most people in accessibility think that accessibility is a byproduct of the technology implementation portion of the project, but I believe it is the opposite. It actually should follow the same methodologies of building a house. It should start at the foundation, the blueprints, right? You have to vet to make sure that everything that is going to be proposed or that you are going to experience or interact with is accessible. I believe in asking the right questions, and the first place that I do it at is talk through the experience. So when I sit down with user experience folks, I basically ask them to explain the experience in layman's terms, not in technical, design details. It like, what do you want them to do? How do you want them to interact with it? An example would be, the user will move their mouse and hover over a call to action then they click the call to action, upon clicking the call to action, maybe a modal appears you know, the user will interact with that modal, right, and then when they decide to close the modal, they'll move on. So that's the interaction. But how does that actually get translated into what it is that we are doing? So those are the questions that I will engage with people to make sure that they're actually able to explain it to me in the most simplest terms. A modal or call to action is fairly simple, so let's just hypothetically talk about something like a new, you know, way to navigate, or add to cart, or shop or drag and drop, whatever it could be, can they explain the experience to me in the most simplest terms. Those will usually lead to things that tell us to design patterns and standards. Then I basically say, okay so now we've got the experience explained out, from more of a foundational point of view, I'll go to kind of like the decorating or the design elements. So I would likely sit down with the design team at that point, and  basically, I would ask them we expect designers to, you know, get creative, get like blue style, they want to be the most innovative they want to be the most creative folks. But it's important for them in particular to understand the feature or the intent, in addition to what it looks like. So my example is, this designer wants to use a switch, right, like an on off kind of like toggle you've seen them on mobile devices all the time, but they might not fully understand, both technically and experience what that switch actually is. Does everybody, can they visualize an on off like switch toggle like right? Most, I would say, probably on the record like 90 plus percent of the time, a switch is a boolean, right? In technical terms, an on or off, yes or no, true or false, right? Zero or one. And in that case, most times when you are switching, with those terms in play, you're actually using a form, or you're submitting data, a yes no answer response

So it's checkbox, it's a simple checkbox, right? So if the designer doesn't know the intent of it of how it is going to be implemented or how it's going to be interacted with, they may design an on off switch that might not work the same way a checkbox would work and that's a big problem. And we've probably seen it a thousand times. Then we come to the technical aspect of it. And it's like do we understand the implementation? So, developers can read documentation and they can learn all the W3C standards and things like that. But, it's often that the developer looks at like a set of wires or a Photoshop document and then just goes off and builds something, right, and understanding the design pattern to follow and the intent of the design element is the key to successfully executing it with accessibility in mind. So, take the switch, right?
So like how do they implement the design but as a radio or a checkbox? Or how do they create this new fancy like custom dropdown, like simple state selection UI, but they want it fancy with flags or with you know borders or whatever like we can implement that, but if it doesn't follow the standards and if it doesn't follow the design patterns, you won't be able to use it. And most actual backends won't be able to consume it. So it's really important for the developers to not just consume the documentation but to understand the intent, standards and the design patterns, because that's where they will know which tags to use, which ARIA, things like that and so forth. I wanted to show you some examples of where, I think, the industry at large has missed and has done well.

Ok, so this is a little video. So hopefully you can kind of see it. You'll see my mouse move. This is an example of a bad modal pattern. And just so I can throw them under the bus, this is jQuery modal dot com. So, number one in the search results, right? So what you'll see here is, I'm tabbing, so I'm using the keyboard to go between links and I click that call to action and its really hard to see because the screen is so dark, but when it opens again, I'm tabbing, and I'm actually tabbing the page links, not the modal links. So I can't actually interact with the modal at all. It's completely inaccessible. So it doesn't follow either the standards or the design patterns, which I'll get into a little bit later.

**[Attendee]:** Sorry I'm not clear.

**[Seth]:** Ok, I"m going to show you really quick. So I'm using a keyboard only to get to this. And I click enter. And it's really dark, but what you'll see is once the modal opens,  you'll see that it's moving in the background. But I'm not able to interact with the components within the modal, like I can't actually click the close button and I can't click the blue call-to-action inside the modal, the close. So, making that modal...

**[Attendee]:** keyboard

**[Seth]:** Correct  

**[Attendee]:** OK. So someone with a visual disability in particular needs to use a keyboard but someone, let's say, with Parkinson's, they may not be using a mouse because of you know, motor disabilities and they'll force themselves, more structurally, to use the keyboard. So, this particular modal, if you implemented this on your website, it would be completely unaccessible to people with disabilities. On the other hand, I found a good one, which believe it or not is Bootstrap, so, this is the call to action, and you'll notice now i'm actually interacting with the element in the model now can you see I'm tabbing the same type of thing but once I'm open I'm now forced inside the model and I have to make a decision to either act on it or close it so this is a actual good design path so basically  you tab to the call to action, you click or enter to open it you focus on the model which is the blue ring around the white box you click tab, your tab lock aside and you can either close the model or return to your call to action. That's the other key feature to, is when you close it, you return back to where you came from unrecognisable chatter ... a good design pattern with regards to a modal. Ok.

So let's look at some , you know, some more examples. So what I want to do here quickly if this works is I'm gonna switch to my browser,  which I did. Ok 

**[Dennis]:** Oh, That part is not straight

**[Seth]:** Ohhhh, really, even if I don't, if I share the hangout? Where's my hangout? Maybe I need to share ...

**[Dennis]:** Yeah, again I think ... Ok, but I'm gonna to move this over so you don't see it twice. So, this is an example of actually, the W3C, they link to this ... but this is like a tooltip so let me go back here really quickly. So a tool tip, so according to ... Alright, maybe I won't change ... change screens ... technical difficulties ... Ok, well, this is the wrong screen but that's alright, that's ok well we'll stick with this for now.

**[Dennis]:** well, yeah, unfortunately I think it's looping on to itself

270
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,100
**[Seth]:** Yeah,  that's a issue with Hangout. Ok. Well now you see my notes but that's ok ...

**[Dennis]:** Those are not shared, your site notes.

**[Seth]:** right

**[Dennis] Oh here they are but not ...

**[Seth]:** Right. Ok, so basically this is ... according to the W3C, at the bottom here I linked to it and this particular, you know, example is with, you know, tooltips so a tooltip is like if you hover on something you get a real dialog of sorts, so a popup that displays a description for an element when the user passes over or rests on the element, supplements to a normal tooltip, blah blah blah ... but here's the key, right, so the triggering element to which the tooltip is attached link should never actually lose input or focus. So accordingly to the W3C for a tooltip there's a rule to be followed. Right? And the next one is if the tooltip is invoked when the trigger element gets focused then it should be dismissed when it no longer has focus. So those are things that user experienced people need to know and developers need to know when their actually like saying hey, this is what it is that I'm going to represent, so, let me try and switch here.

I know I might have to go back ... hold on ... you can see that, now I'm going to become an expert at this soon

**[Dennis]:** [Laugh]

**[Seth]:** You think ... if I can find my hangout ... thats cool. I think ... two screens ... Ok, this will help. This is was actually my intention on how I would fill up time ...

**[Dennis]:** [Laugh] ... good job ...

**[Seth]:** Ok, so we're sharing this right? Ok, so everybody can see. So this is an example of a tooltip. So I mouse over this field and it says oh your first name is optional and I moused over another field, you know, your last name is optional and it disappears. If I'm in the box it stays there, if I leave the box technically, oh my mouse is still there. So when I switch between these, these tooltips are showing and hiding according to the spec. So this is key so when someone goes and reinvents the wheel or thinks of another way to do it the best place for everybody to start is is back at the design pattern and the standards. Ok, let me show you one more so I don't have to keep going back and forth between things so here is another one on Bootstrap right so if I hover it shows up on the left if I hover it shows up on the right you know whatever that with the mouse. If I get to this, on it here, eventually you'll see I'm tabbing, I'm not using my mouse and hopefully somewhere down here is a tooltip ... this is a whole different discussion to have.

Let's see here ... So I should follow the thing.  Oh, here we go. So you'l see that I've tabbed on the tooltip on the right and I've tabbed that I'm on the top, the bottom, the top, left, and if I go through it shows a lot it's a perfect example of following spec so there's rules to be, you know, followed and so forth. Let me show one more. Another tool tip, right so if I come down to here ... so it's like this guy right? So if I tap to these guys, it shows me, if I tap out, goes to the next one and so forth, so again a simple example of following the spec.

Let's go back ... So were talking about like the ability to interact with it right now, but technically making it accessible for screen readers is a whole separate step so one thing I tell the people that I am auditing or that I say "Hey, is this accessible or not?" the number one thing I say is "go use your keyboard." If you can't interact with it with the keyboard, I can pretty much guarantee you're not going to be able to use it with a screen reader. So foundation again, if you can't use it with a keyboard you're likely not going to be able to use it with a screenreader. If you can use it with your keyboard you got to go to the next level kind of like a video game. Which I think is over here ...

**[Attendee]:**  So, the process of, it's keyboard accessible, means the screen reader won't get stuck inside the modal. But, it still doesn't mean the modal is usable.

**[Seth]:** So are you talking about the tool tip or the modal? I just want to make sure we're talking about the same thing. So in this case the tooltip ... so the question was again just repeat it so ...

**[Attendee]:** So if not getting through it on a keyboard is not a problem ...

**[Seth]:** Not necessarily, because ... think about it from let's say someone that's forced to use a keyboard, but isn't visually impaired they are going to use the keyboard to navigate to something and they are going to want to know what that acronym is or whatever it is at the tooltip is and because they can't use the mouse they need to have that thing be visible. So that information is pertinent enough for them to access.

**[Attendee]:** So, this would be ... of keyboard, ah ...

**[Seth]:** Well, that's the baseline. So then you take it to the next level and someone is totally blind, what you would do
which is getting a little deeper into the later parts of the presentation is, you can add extra elements like ARIA that will make it ... the information, the supplemental information available verbally for auditory, right so they will never see the tooltip but they know that when they tap to it, it says "ABC has tooltip" and it will say "ABC is a XYZ" or whatever, it will announce to them whatever you programmatically want to tell them.

**[Attendee]:**  I just didn't know, I never tried it.

**[Seth]:** Makes perfect sense. Ok, so that was a tool tip. One more, ok  this is my favorite one. There's too much to read through here, but a date picker, right, I'm not going to through you under the bus, but I'm going to use one of your competitors. Ok, so a date picker is, you have a field, right and it says "when do you wana leave" or "what's your birthday" or whatever and you tab into it and it says, oh this big magical popup says, with a calendar looking thing, right? Ok, so that is what a date picker is. And this goes into significant detail of what the spec and what the standards are, of how that date picker should or shouldn't work and to give you an idea, I needed two pages plus. I didn't even go down that. I'll read a couple of these as an example, so you have a good understanding. So basically, keyboard navagation on days that are not included on the currently displayed month should move to the month automatically and lead to the date in the next previous month. So basically when you focus in, the highlight of the component should go to today. Then there's like tab, like other widgets, the date picker receives focus by tabbing in, once focus is received, focus is repositioned on today's date in the grid, on the day of the week a second tab will take the user out of the date picker wizard focusing initially is placed on today's date so most date pickers don't follow that. I'll show you that when you tab and it focuses the date picker, if you hit tab again it might actually start tabbing through the dates which means you can never get out of it.

So using something like shift tab reverses the direction of the tab focus or up and down arrows that allows you to actually pick supplemental dates  ... we'll get into that and things like that so there's a really really long list and I put down here which you can't see in the presentation a link to the spec that is overwhelming and I guarantee you that those UX people that are envisioning the next best date picker which most airlines are usually trying to do because they want an easier hotels in particular, I've gone through these conversations they wana make it simple and intuitive in check in check out  ya know departure return they want it really cool and really innovative but there never following the specs here so I can't find a single one that follows the spec and I looked but I did however, find some that do let's go show what let's get outa here and go back to my little example which I'm becoming expert at this now, come on

Ok, I want share my screen ... I'm not sharing

Let's go to this one, this fantastic one distributed by the largest JavaScript framework known to man basically. Ok, everybody starts here so I'm going to show you what it looks like with a mouse first so I enter in here and I get this fancy little date thing, I can go back and forth and you know I can pick the seventeenth and I can do this and all that kinda stuff, right? But lets try to do it with a mouse ok I mean with a keyboard I hit tab ok and tab number one but it immediately closes. I hit tab ok and tab number one but it immediately closes. Ok so I hit tab, I can't use it. I hit the arrows, I'm hitting the arrows, and all I am doing is cycling through you know the dates. The actual date picker module is not accessible. 

Should we try something else? Shift Enter? Ok, I'm just winging it with you.

Shift Enter. Ok.

One could argue, and this is where the debates will typically happen, is that, does the actual picker itself need to be made accessible? One could argue that I could just type my date. I'm not blocked by doing this with the keyboard. One one, two thousand twenty, right? I didn't get the date picker, I was able to enter my date but I'm not getting the same experience, so to speak. So that's where the debate will likely come in. But, if you are going to try to create an inclusive design, one for all and all for one, you would likely want the date picker to be available to people with certain disabilities, they can fast and easily use it just like if I were to use a mouse. Bad example. Let's go to a good one.

Let's go to ... this one is okay. So this is pickadate, so I found a different plug-in. So this one looks really cool, right? And I can click these arrows and I can pick a date I can even go to today and I can clear my entry. All that kind of stuff. A great user experience so to speak, I'm not going to go too much into detail. But for a mouse user, its fantastic, right? If I'm using it on a keyboard, I can actually use this. It doesn't follow the spec, because I can't do things like, you know, Shift-Enter, I don't have these things memorized, like go from today's date from a previous month but I can at least interact and go and use it. So it is a much better following practice of both the standards and the design spec. One more here ... And this is where I apologize to Dennis

**[Dennis]:** You're right. You're right

**[Seth]:** So, I'm ... if you guys want to see some really good accessibility, like, I just started really nit-picking this site, it's very good, and it's getting even better, and I didn't realize there was a standard or a date timeline for all the airlines. And now it makes perfect sense to me. Why this is so good. Because I would have expected this to be bad. But, so date picker. So you get this cool thing, it's awesome, it shows me two months at a time and I can go forward, I can go back with a mouse and it shows me really, visually how awesome this this is. If I use it with a mouse, I mean a keyboard ... I'll get into the bottom section of this in a little bit. But, I can actually, if I can remember, I don't remember the controls. So there, I'm going. So I can go forward, I can go down, I can actually go month to month if I click there, right. All of these kind of things. This is impressive. Ok, and there are actually, if we reviewed those design patterns, according to ARIA all of those, or most of them are pretty available. The other thing that I will highlight at the bottom, is really impressive. So let me explain this quickly, and then I'll get into it in more detail.

Notice how when I use my mouse, you don't see that bottom. But when I use my keyboard, I do.

452
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,860
That's awesome and I'll explain why in a little bit.

453
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,080
Ok, so let me go back to this guy.

454
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,620
I don't have much more. I do not have much more.

455
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,420
Ok, so, we couldn't find the specs, so now let's talk about ARIA.

456
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:56,720
Right, so this is like the technical thing that some of you may or may not be aware of.

457
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,700
ARIA is the Accessible Rich Internet Applications suite, defines a way to make web content

458
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:08,440
and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with the dynamic content

459
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:15,100
and advance users, interface controls, development with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript and related technologies.

460
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,840
So this is basically like a secondary language
to what we do, that helps

461
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,840
code talk to assistive technologies, 
and assistive technologies to talk to code.

462
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:33,120
So all of those design patterns basically got augmented and got enhanced with ARIA.

463
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:40,260
So, understanding some basics, this is a little more technical, so let me know if you have any questions.

464
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,280
Sight and mobility-impaired users must be able to

465
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,540
quickly access a list of landmarks
for a web page that they use.

466
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:53,060
So basically think of it like a table of contents, so we want to define using landmarks.

467
00:40:54,020 --> 00:41:00,580
Code, on the page, that tells a user with various disabilities that there's a navigation,

468
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:07,900
there's a side navigation, there's a search, there's content, you want to be explicit so they can, you know,

469
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,140
go to those areas with ease. Remember those examples with tabbing tabbing tabbing tabbing,

470
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:17,320
and trying to get to something? This prevents that because they can use assistive technology to

471
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,200
access shortcuts to skip the navigation,
we've all heard that, right?

472
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,940
Skip to navigation when you first tab?
This eliminates that.

473
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:31,760
You don't have to add some extra visual and contextual, you can just basically add some code

474
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,840
and they automatically add this glorious
table of contents.

475
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:44,180
Roles. So, once you get landmarks, then you might want to specify each particular thing.

476
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:52,460
What is this? So like, it's a banner, right? It's a main section, it's a navigation. It's a search.

477
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:59,500
Imagine you trying to execute a specific task, and there's a lot of content on that page.

478
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:06,120
This is a way for you to quickly access something without question of what it is.

479
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,860
And this is something that really is very foundational.

480
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:17,100
This takes a developer no effort whatsoever to implement. It just takes him to do it.

481
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:22,340
But there's no advanced learnings. Just understanding what is available and going from there.

482
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,180
And then we get into a little more advanced stuff.

483
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,200
So States and Properties.

484
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,720
And this is where ARIA kicks in.

485
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:35,920
So this is, prior to ARIA, there was no consistent, bidirectional, cross-browser implementation between

486
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,140
assistive technologies and applications to communicate.

487
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,260
So like for instance, take my on off switch, right?

488
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:52,660
I can click it or I can tab it, bit there was no way for a custom built switch

489
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,580
to communicate with an assistive technology.

490
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,120
Because there's that no standard, right? We are losing the communication gap.

491
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:08,520
So ARIA allows us to do things like expanded or checked or selected or labelledby, there's a lot of that.

492
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:14,100
So like take a toggle, right. Open, close. Well, it is expanded. Or it is not expanded.

493
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,260
It's checked, or it's not checked.

494
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:23,680
We can build very creative experiences and visual designs now, and use ARIA

495
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,200
to bridge the communication gap between those technologies.

496
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,540
There's so much to go into that I couldn't do it here. But to give you an example of

497
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:38,200
where it can be applied is like, so take ARIA for content strategists.

498
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:47,800
One of the common things they always complain about is "click here" or "explore" or, they want to be

499
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,780
very simple and plain in their nomenclature of buttons in particular.

500
00:43:53,480 --> 00:44:02,480
So, they can add contextual elements that are not visually there, but are to the assistive technologies

501
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,400
using labelledby or describedby. Or they can actually announce what's actually happened.

502
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:16,480
So, it's hard to see, but in the case of Southwest, when I actually focus in to the box

503
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,640
this black area here is what the screen reader is actually reading.

504
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:28,660
Ok, so it's reading, content selected, date depart, date depart and formats mm dd

505
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,140
valid dates for March fourth and November fourth, keyboard instructions up down arrow

506
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:39,380
access the widget shift right, I mean like, imagine coming to this for the very first time

507
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,320
and not having that instruction

508
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,460
There would be no way for you to know how to use that unless you were following the design pattern to spec.

509
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,500
Which we've all clearly noticed it's very hard to do.

510
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:57,480
So, content strategists can add contextual information to help for accessibility.

511
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:04,740
So this is an example of where you can go the extra mile if the people are thinking about the intent.

512
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:12,640
Another one is for UX folks. So, Apple is a great example. They kill it when is comes to accessibility.

513
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,100
So, what I'm doing is I'm using the search box,
using the keyboard.

514
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:22,180
And the things that I've noticed is, they're using ARIA autocomplete

515
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:27,900
to tell the user that while you start typing your search phrase, that basically a list of things are autocompleting

516
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:33,700
so, you'll see it's giving me hints. It's telling me that
that's actually happening.

517
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,680
ARIA has popup. It told me that its popping up with a new feature or so fourth.

518
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,120
So these are the things that the developers can implement without any question.

519
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:53,160
But it's the user experience people, to go back to that intent, how do I want them to use it?

520
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,280
How do I want them to interact with it? If they don't tell the developer that

521
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03,540
the developers won't necessarily know what ARIA to actually use, okay?

522
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,840
This is for the geeks in the room.

523
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:13,640
The bad news for you front-end web developers is, for you to do this right,

524
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,000
developers not only need to utilize the appropriate ARIA roles, states and properties,

525
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,620
they also have to leverage and use JavaScript to help manage the constant flux of

526
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,280
content, interactions and states.

527
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,740
Some of the things to think about while leveraging all the JavaScript are

528
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,260
that sites using JavaScript typically will be fully accessible.

529
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:39,780
There's been a lot of data to show that people, even with people with assistive technologies

530
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,420
they don't disable JavaScript anymore.

531
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:46,200
So all of the screen readers and other assistive technologies are being incorporated

532
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,420
with JavaScript enabled, through ARIA and following those specs and standards.

533
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:57,420
Ensure that your scripts are both mouse and keyboard enabled. A typical one is

534
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:04,880
you'll use a click handler. Well, a click handler isn't focus, right? It's not keyboard. It's click. Things like that.

535
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,040
You have to actually think about all the extra JavaScript that you'll have to work with

536
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,660
especially, I think I heard someone talk about Ember.

537
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:19,820
You know, like if you're talking about single page application that is constantly changing in its state,

538
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,720
This is going to be a lot of work.

539
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,660
Leverage dependent and independant event triggers.

540
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:31,880
This is relatively new actually, 
or at least I thought is was.

541
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,580
You can track if it's a click or keyboard event

542
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,640
So go back to that Southwest example.

543
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,880
They didn't show the additional help at the bottom if I used my mouse.

544
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:51,820
But if I used my keyboard, it added actual content and context to the screen.

545
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:59,000
So they're using independent and dependent triggers to differentiate between mouse and keyboard.

546
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,580
So they're going the extra mile,
with that type of philosophy.

547
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,180
Managing focus and refocus, so like, a good example is,

548
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:11,820
we always thinking about going somewhere, but if they close it or if they do a negative action,

549
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:20,240
does it take them back to where they were. Like one thing I often find is like, when I use a table of contents

550
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,100
if I click the table of contents, and I get sent down to the bottom of the page,

551
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,920
but what happens when I want to get back?

552
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:35,380
There's no way back. You have to tab shift all the way through every single link to get back.

553
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:41,420
There should be potentially a way to track where you came from and where you might want to go back.

554
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,220
Things like that.

555
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,840
And then the biggest one for you developers, read and follow the design patterns.

556
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,820
I cannot emphasize that enough.

557
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:56,580
There are, there's so much but that really the only way to make the assistive technologies

558
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:01,720
to be able to communicate to the browser 
is through the standards.

559
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,800
Some don't follow them, some do but at least we can go with the baseline.

560
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:12,620
So, here's an example of all of the design patterns that are already specified.

561
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,380
Accordions, alert boxes, dialogs, autocomplete, buttons, checkboxes, comboboxes, date pickers, modals,

562
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:27,340
drag and drop, grid, I mean, I'm guessing there might be a small percentage of user experiences out there

563
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:32,720
that comes up wth something brand new. But you can't, I would be surprised if you can't correlate it back to this.

564
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,620
So like, take an accordion.
Oh, not an accordion, a carousel.

565
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:44,220
There's no carousel in this. So let's think about it, break it apart. Buttons, content, links.

566
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:49,360
Each little piece of the carousel can be broken up into a standard.

567
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:55,780
And that's really where you want to focus on both, I would say if you are a UX person,

568
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:01,980
this is a great place to start building that next best experience but following the standard

569
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:10,840
take the turnstyle door, right? If you follow these, it'll be more easy to recognize, know how it works,

570
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,900
you won't be pushing it, you won't be bouncing it because it's going to slow or whatever may be,

571
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:19,460
and then from a developers point of view, this is the place where you really need to

572
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:25,520
make sure, because if you don't follow these at least the majority of the way through,

573
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,900
screen readers in particular won't be accessible.

574
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,060
And that concludes the presentation.

575
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,420
Thank you.

576
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:39,700
[Applause]

577
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,820
[Dennis]: Any questions...

578
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,900
[Steve]: So, how does this impact mobile phones?

579
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,600
[Seth]: So, it impacts nearly one to one.

580
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:59,900
If you are talking about native application, so like your Facebook app, there's a lot more nuance

581
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:04,020
and a lot more spec out there that hasn't been defined.

582
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,440
But I would say that if you are talking mobile web, so like responsive design,

583
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:14,720
like, screen readers on mobile phones are following the same standards as desktops are.

584
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:21,540
And the design pattern, if you think about the analogy of roads or outlooks or whatever,

585
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:27,840
it's the same thing, right, a switch is a switch, a carousel is a carousel, whether it is in a native app

586
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:34,040
or in a web page, it's the same intuitive thing. The only thing that is different is how you interact with it.

587
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:39,940
So if you're able-bodied, you might use swipe, right?
For something, or touch, or tap.

588
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:46,980
If you're not, you use a screen reader that basically has to intuitively, you know,

589
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:51,600
communicate to whatever it is that it wants to do, and what it should be doing.

590
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,320
So, if you have an iPhone, try your VoiceOver on it.

591
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:02,780
It's awesome. It does it very well. And you'll find that the sites or the apps that are following most of the patterns

592
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,200
are the ones you can actually use.

593
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:09,020
So I would say that in most cases, it's a one to one.

594
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:14,660
[Steve]: Great. And then the second question, most of these things are JavaScript?

595
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:27,600
[Seth]: No, so, most, so the screen where I had landmarks, roles and then states and properties,

596
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:34,800
landmarks and roles are pure HTML. They are just straight-up HTML. There are no ifs, ands or buts.

597
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:42,100
The state changing, when you need to interact with it on a dynamic element

598
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,580
so, does everybody understand what stateless
or state means?

599
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,000
It means that it is either ... like static or it can be a constant across ...

600
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,800
if it doesn't have a state, that it can change, you have to track that through JavaScript.

601
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:02,140
So there are instances of sites out there that don't really leverage a lot of dynamically changing components

602
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:09,520
and elements that you can make purely accessible, which is some basic ARIA tags, roles and landmarks.

603
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,660
[Attendee]: I have a question

604
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,220
[Seth]: Sure.

605
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:22,860
[Attendee]: So I read somewhere where ARIA was ... and a lot of the default HTML5

606
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,600
elements and landmarks actually have the ARIA ...  within them.

607
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,100
[Seth]: Correct.

608
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:40,720
[Attendee]: So would it be better to just try to ...
I don't know, not be so redundant ...

609
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:47,900
[Seth]: Correct. So in the absence of, if I were to use the nav tag, which is navigation,

610
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:52,580
you wouldn't need to add role navigation to it.
You would not need to do that.

611
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:57,080
But in the instance of, you know, progressive enhancement and graceful degradation,

612
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:02,300
when you have to accommodate a non-HTML5 browser, you then need to

613
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:07,480
a shim it, if no one knows what that is, I will explain later, but be basically, add the role.

614
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,860
That's usually what shimming will do.

615
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:16,900
But, yes, generally speaking, you don't need to over tag, and the way to learn more about that is

616
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,060
what I do a lot now, which is, a lot quicker and a lot easier is to use a fiddle, like a js fiddle or like a codepen

617
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:28,700
I'll stick one tiny tag in that fiddle and I'll open up my screen reader

618
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:35,240
rather than going through the whole page and figuring out the page, I will go component and elements alone

619
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,160
and hear it and learn from it and see if it actually works.

620
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,920
It's an extra step, it's kind of a poc, a proof of concept.

621
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:47,900
So, thats how I'll do that. You could go in,
type a tag and test it and be like

622
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:52,260
"ok, well, maybe that's not intuitive enough,
I'm going to add something else."

623
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:57,660
[Dennis]: We actually did something similar, we've had an ongoing debate

624
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:10,560
between aria-label, aria-labelledby and aria-describedby. We had one of our folks in requirements saying

625
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:18,280
aria-labelledby and then the text they want to appear. For any of you who do not know,

626
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:25,160
aria-labelledby and describedby, they typically point to an ID, which has the textual content

627
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:32,880
that is describing the label. Aria-label actually contains the text string that is used as the label.

628
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:42,600
But we ... I knew that as being the fact, but the UX person that I'm collaborated with kept on saying

629
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:52,760
aria-describedby and then the text. So I literally created just a flat, HTML file with every variation of these three

630
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:58,300
ARIAs used, and then we just listened to it in two different screen readers and said

631
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:07,940
done. And I think that's really what you have to do with ARIA. In our initial requirements,

632
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:12,500
the requirements folks, next to every link,
would say role equals link.

633
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,100
And I'm like ... all that extra work.

634
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,580
[Seth]: Yeah, there's intent for each of them.

635
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:23,480
And understanding the intent of them could sometimes be ambiguous.

636
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:28,320
But like, just like, for front-end developers, when do you use an ID and when do you use a class

637
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,340
or when do you use a data selector, all of these type of things come into the discussion.

638
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:39,820
There is original intent behind those attributes and parameters. And if you stick to the original intent,

639
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:47,540
you'll likely succeed more across a wider range than if you change it, like for instance, like

640
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:53,960
I could not use any class or ID on any div or any element ever, right?

641
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:59,140
And I could use data selectors. I could manipulate it and manage the page any way I wanted to.

642
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:07,880
It's possible. Should you? No. So you want to try and research back to the intent of the littlest nuance

643
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:14,360
to ensure that the widest range of things are actually working. So like labelledby would widely be used

644
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:22,100
for a one to many relationship. So you have one description like "this link opens in a new window"

645
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:29,380
but you have ten links on the page. So those ten links will have labelledby and that one ID

646
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:36,560
like Dennis said, and your leveraging a better experience and a better codebase to do it as well.

647
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:44,740
[Attendee]: How different would you say the experience is between different screen readers?

648
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,420
[Seth]: I'm glad you asked.

649
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:59,460
I would say that it is an exact, same paradigm as between Safari, Firefox, Mozilla, IE, Chrome

650
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,520
It is just a different browser.

651
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:11,560
I mean, essentially what it is. NVDA doesn't do exactly what JAWS does, JAWS doesn't do what VoiceOver does

652
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,440
They're all trying to follow the specs but they all behave differently.

653
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:22,500
[Dennis]: One thing I'll say about that, just from an experience within the last six to eight months is

654
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:34,460
it's also a difference between platforms ... JAWS, handle things in a similar manner.

655
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:42,500
JAWS is more robust than NVDA. Safari which is on a different platform, reads the DOM in a different manner.

656
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:51,300
Therefore, certain things that may work in JAWS and NVDA does not seem to work in Safari

657
00:58:51,300 --> 00:59:00,840
It doesn't mean that Safari is broken, it just that it does it differently. From my experience, Safari and VoiceOver

658
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:10,480
are the most strict combination that you can use. So if you don't know if something works or not,

659
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,560
try it in Safari and VoiceOver first, then test on the Windows platform.

660
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:20,920
[Seth]: Right, and it's also a paradigm between which screen reader or assistive technology you are using

661
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,020
and which browser you are using.

662
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:23,960
[Dennis]: Don't use Chrome.

663
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:28,620
[Seth]: Right? So for instance, you're using VoiceOver and you're using Chrome,

664
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:35,880
it won't work as well if you're using VoiceOver with Safari. Or if you're using JAWS with Firefox

665
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,920
versus JAWS with IE.

666
00:59:37,920 --> 01:00:32,720
[Attendee]: [Unrecognizable]

667
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,980
[Dennis]: So, two things. They're not telling us.

668
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,100
[Laughter]

669
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:50,620
[Dennis]: So two things. One, WebAim, which is a website, they have an annual screen reader survey.

670
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:56,640
Check out the survey, the last one was last July, they'll likely be putting out another one soon.

671
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:04,000
And they tell you the combinations of browser and screen reader, and it actually changed big time last year

672
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:12,660
because of the folks that run Windows Eyes, they actually announced to their users

673
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:19,420
that there was a survey going on and NVDA dropped clear to second to last place

674
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:27,980
and Windows Eyes was second to JAWS. But you'll get a feel for how actually screen reader users are

675
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:34,520
using the tools, with which browsers and such, that's a great resource.

676
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,920
Now, how are the airlines handling it?

677
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:41,940
[Attendee]: Somebody is going to come back and judge you, right?

678
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:54,460
[Dennis]: Yes, and that is the users. So, it's been an emotional roller coaster the last year

679
01:01:54,460 --> 01:02:01,420
because the DOT is not telling us what their going to do. First, we thought they were going to hire auditors.

680
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:13,240
What's going to happen is, when users find an issue, they won't come to us, they'll go to the DOT.

681
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:19,840
The DOT will file a complaint with us, we have however long, we don't even know how long the grace period is

682
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:27,000
but we will have, however many weeks to fix that particular problem, or else we will be fined

683
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,880
$27,000 dollars per instance per day.

684
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:36,320
[Seth]: The thing to keep in mind, and I'll kind of go back to the original question

685
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:42,040
so A: if you are in the position to make a choice of what requirements you have

686
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,320
just like any sort of requirements, you follow the numbers.

687
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,660
So like JAWS is 75% of the screen reader market.

688
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:53,320
So by using ChromeVox, which is a good example,
it's like zero percent.

689
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,520
So it's a testing tool.

690
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:59,140
[Dennis]: Yeah, it's a testing tool, we actually thought it would be great for our developers,

691
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:06,920
because it's like handy. Experience has told us that it works completely differently

692
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:12,380
As well as Chrome in general works differently with any screen reader.

693
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:18,180
We're heavy Chrome users for development, but when it comes time to using a screen reader,

694
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:23,140
open up Firefox and NVDA or IE and JAWS.

695
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:30,280
[Seth]: Just like you would do in a normal QA cycle, so at Critical Mass, we test every browser

696
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,800
that meets our client's or the industry's requirements.

697
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:44,120
So, when it comes down to it, we can't guarantee that it'll work in every single browser and every single device

698
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:50,280
or every single orientation, it's not possible. But we can do our best.

699
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:55,120
And our best, the easiest way to achieve the best, is to follow the specs.

700
01:03:55,120 --> 01:04:02,680
And I will say that, in my experience, JAWS and VoiceOver and NVDA, they all behave

701
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:09,760
very very similar from a code perspective, you might just need to know the nuances

702
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:18,220
of how to access that. Like, as a tester. So, your testers might actually not know how to use the devices

703
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:23,040
or the assistive technology well enough, and they'll get false positives.

704
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:30,060
So just like I did an example, I pulled up Southwest, I couldn't figure it out, I said ok, that's how.

705
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:35,660
It was eventually accessible, once I remembered the right types of things to do.

706
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:42,540
So your testers have to really know the devices that they're using to test on.

707
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:49,620
It's like, a mobile phone or a desktop, you test differently from a mobile phone to a desktop, right?

708
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:56,800
You test differently from NVDA to JAWS, JAWS to VoiceOver. So if you're doing the full gamut,

709
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,360
it's part of the biz, so to speak.

710
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:22,640
[Attendee]: Dennis, the Feds, there's no way the Feds will ...

711
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,320
[Seth]: There's a question back over here.

712
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:32,240
[Attendee]: ...

713
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:41,040
[Seth]: So yes. So that is the W3C created WCAG 2.0, which is relatively recent, and then there's three levels,

714
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:47,360
within that, so that's the standards that basically both the browsers are following and

715
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:52,600
the assistive technologies are trying to mimic towards, but as we all know,

716
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:57,600
browsers and companies and businesses like to make their own nuances

717
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:05,720
and they don't always follow the standards, right? And that's why we have kit CSS, we have Mozilla,

718
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:10,900
hyphen Mozilla because they wanted to do something before the standard was finished

719
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:17,480
or before there was a standard. So every browser and every assistive technology,

720
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:23,580
they all try and follow a certain set of rules, but this is not a perfect utopia.

721
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,660
So that rarely ever happens.

722
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,680
[Dennis]: We have time for one more question.

723
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:46,880
[Attendee]: ...

724
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:56,460
[Dennis]: So, that ... I believe that was started by Stephen Faulkner who contributes to the W3C spec for ARIA.

725
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:03,340
But also on WebAim.org their forum, let's put it this way,

726
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:09,740
I joined the International Association of Accessibility Professionals last year

727
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:17,860
primarily for the forums. I did not renew, because WebAim, and their forums, which are free,

728
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:22,940
are almost richer for my particular needs.

729
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:34,120
It's a little antiquated, because it's driven by email. But if you want to learn like ...

730
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:39,500
I started a thread, however many months ago, a button versus a link.

731
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:46,660
And actually, the information I was receiving, which was from like Steven Faulkner from the W3C

732
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:53,960
and Leonie Watson and such, they were contradicting what the advice we were being given

733
01:07:53,960 --> 01:08:04,860
by an agency, and that was helpful because I actually have a high level of respect for these particular people.

734
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:14,900
They basically said, code to spec, let the assistive technology catch up, which sounds like IE, so.

735
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:19,180
It's just history repeating itself.

736
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:24,240
Well, once again, Seth, thank you so much.

737
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:29,520
[Applause]

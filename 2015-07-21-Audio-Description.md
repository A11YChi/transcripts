**[Martin]:** My name is Martin Wilde, and I am a Chicago-based audio description writer and voicer.

In general, what we're going to go over tonight is kind of a definition of audio description we're going to look at where that is applied, some of the rules for audio description. You'll actually get a fairly in-depth overview of what audio description really is and some of the rules of audio description and how that is applied to media and live performance. And then I have about 3 or 4 videos, a couple of commercials and then a snippet of a film I did that will show audio description in action. I have a list of resources at the end and then I can take any questions you might have after that.

So, what is Audio Description? Well, as I talk about, or gave Dennis in the run up to this meetup, Audio Description makes visual images accessible for people who are blind or have low vision. Using words that are succinct, vivid and imaginative, the description translates the visual image into an aural form that is accessible to these individuals. For the performing arts and media, description inserts this narrative into the natural pauses in the dialog between critical sound events. So ... that's easy enough. But, I'd like to take a little time, to delve a little more deeply into what that really means.

Easy enough, its another way to think about it is to say what you see. We are doing a translation from the visual to the aural. Now, typically, we think of a translation as, oh say, going from French to English or the other way around. I'm getting ahead of myself I'll follow my slides here.

There are many different names for Audio Description. Audio Description is used a lot in the US. They use this logo to identify Audio Descriptions, so it's a square box with a capital block-letter A and D and to the right of the D there are three sound waves emanating from the curve of the D. So that is the symbol for Audio Description in the United States. In Canada, they use Described Video, and that is just a block-letter D, with two sound waves emanating from the right side curve of the D. Some people also call it Video Description. But when you abbreviate that to block letters ... it's rather unfortunate ... um ... element 

[Laughter] 

**[Martin]:** so we don't call it Video Description.

The people who use Audio Description are obviously people who are blind or who have low vision.

So who are they, who is this population. According to a report from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, 20.6 million adults age 18 or older reported experiencing vision loss. So here, the term "vision loss" refers to individuals who reported they had trouble seeing, even when wearing glasses or contact lenses as well as individuals who reported that they are blind or unable to see at all. This estimate pertains to a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian population 18 years of age or older. Of that population, 12.4 million are women, and 8.2 million are men. 15.3 million are between the ages of 18 and 64 and 5.3 million are 65 years of age or older. And of the 20.1 million people who indicated race on that survey, 16.6 million are white,  2.6 million are black or African-American 2.9 million are hispanic or latino 668,000 are Asian, and 236,000 are American Indian or Alaskan Native. As far as education level is concerned, of the Americans who have vision loss, and are 25 years of age or older, 4 million have less than a high school diploma 5.1 million have a high school diploma or GED, 5.8 million have some college education and 4.1 million have a bachelors degree or higher. So this is not a homogeneous population.

Vision afflictions, whether it's complete blindness or we have retinal neuropathy, or tunnel vision all of these would be rolled into this population. So why do we do this? Well ... the desire in Audio Description is to make the blind or low vision experience as comparable to the sighted experience as possible. So we get into issues of accessibility, we get into issues of independence. If I go into a museum, and I'm blind or have low vision, I'd like to be able to walk around that museum by myself, not necessarily have to have a companion with me. Content equity. I should be able to get as much out of the content that's there as the sighted individual. And overall quality of life, because people who are blind or have low vision tend not to go out as much. They don't participate in social gatherings as much as some other folks. And it's just a real hassle. So, now I've caught up with myself.

Translation. So we typically think of translation again as being across a single sense. So for instance, when I'm translating something from French into English If I'm doing a written version, I write from French, and I write the English equivalent. I can also translate speech in the aural realm from French into English. So that can be modified, that can be codified, and it can be a word for word direct translation. In Audio Description, translation is across the senses. We're translating the visual into the aural. There is no equivalent of a correct or certifiable piece of audio description. Alright, so, you can see that it is more nuanced because it relies on language to step in, and there's no way to define the best sentence to be written, or the best way to say things.

But, just as language has rules about word order and structure, in audio description, those rules are known as standards or best practices, which are a little bit stronger than just recommended guidelines. But for the technically-minded folks like myself, there's got to be some way to do better than just recommended guidelines, right? You can delve into it a bit more, it can be applied to see what some of the challenges are. This title brought up live performance and media.

In the context of audio description, I would put it that audio description, for live performance and media refers solely in the time or temporal domain. In live performance, things are changing, characters are moving, the order in which things are being said can change from one night to the next, from one performance to the next. Whereas in media, I know exactly where all of those gaps are going to be, its a fixed piece of content. And so that makes it a little bit easier.

So it's much easier for me to write a script for a piece of media, knowing how long I have to say and can plan better, and deliver it in that way. So let's look at some of the performance use cases. So for live performance, stuff that moves, there's obviously theater. Now this can be plays. It can be poetry slams. It can be musical acts. It can be an opera. These are all under the heading of theater. I can describe dance. But I'd have to use a different vocabulary to describe tap vs ballet vs modern dance. Corporate functions. Meetings. Social gatherings. Dinner parties and galas. There are conferences. Which can be academic conferences, tradeshows. 

Imagine you are walking around an exhibit floor of a conference. Where are the vendor booths? How do I get from one place to the next? Where are the bathrooms? Where are the meeting rooms themselves? Lectures and webinars. I can listen to a TED talk, or a lecture by an academic professor, but if I can't see the material that they are presenting visually, I'm only getting half, if not less of the information that they are describing.

Architectural tours. Now this is kind of a hybrid, in that, if I'm taking a Chicago boat tour the buildings aren't moving, but my path along the river may change, and the speed in which I go through them changes. I just did a couple of animal shows at the Brookfield Zoo this last Sunday as part of the ADA 25 event I described a dolphin show, and I described a free flight bird show. If you weren't able to see it, well, you're missing kind of what they're doing. Are they doing a backward tail walk, are they doing a forward tail walk, what's that bird that just whizzed by my head? Is that a Red-tail Hawk? What does that look like? So all of these things are lost if I can't get that information.

So remember, the purpose of audio description is to  provide the same, or as equivalent as possible, the experience to the blind or low vision population, as the sighted audience gets. 

So in media we have obviously television shows. If I'm watching a television show, and maybe, sometimes I can't see what the characters are doing. Now often times in the past, people who are blind or low vision, family members or friends would sit next to them and would describe what is going on, to the best of their ability. But, I don't have to rely on that, if I have audio description in the television show itself.

Same thing for movies. If I go to a theater ... one of the first movies I saw that had audio description was ... oh, I'm blanking on it ... it was the ... about the tiger, in the boat, on the ocean ...

**[Audience member]:**  "Life of Pi"

**[Martin]:** "Life of Pi" There are long stretches in "The Life of Pi" where there is no dialog. He's just hanging out at sea. There are times when he looks over the edge of the boat and he sees the myriad of life underneath him, all different colors and shapes swimming by. But that can go on for long stretches of time, and there's nothing, aurally, in the soundtrack of the film to tell you whats going on. So that would really make that experience a whole lot less inclusive.

There's a listsev that is part of the American Council for the Blind, Audio Description Project there was quite a bit of chatter on that website about Netflix movies. So there is a Marvel superhero named Daredevil. Daredevil is blind. But the series itself initially wasn't audio described. So there's an activist here in Chicago named Robert King who's blind and he has started up the Netflix Accessibility Project and has lobbied them to get description for their Netflix produced content. He succeeded in that, and so more and more shows on Netflix and across the realm of television and movies are being described.

I'll talk a little bit later about the Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010. Essentially, there is some legislation that has come online just in the last few years that mandates how much of the broadcaster's programming needs to be audio described.

Cultural institutions. Imagine going to the Art Institute and trying to experience that as a person who is blind or has low vision. What does that painting look like? How do I move around the space? Same thing with Natural History Museums. Sue, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, what does that look like? What do some of the other dinosaurs look like? Without audio description, I have no idea.

Science museums.

163
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,860
Botanical gardens. If I go up to Ravinia and if I walk through the botanical gardens there,

164
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:34,540
those exhibits change, the colors are vivid, the sensory overload is wonderful.

165
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,820
but if I can't see it, I'm missing quite a bit of what's going on.

166
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:45,697
A big part of audio description these days, as far as where the work is coming from

167
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,541
are National Park sites.

168
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:54,101
So the National Park service has a mandate to describe and make accessible all of there current sites.

169
00:13:54,101 --> 00:14:00,901
So I just did an audio tour of Cape Hatteras National Seashore.

170
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:07,780
It's 80 miles long across three islands. There are 80 different stops across that tour.

171
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:14,480
Now obviously I can't get to those stops simply by myself if I was blind or had low vision.

172
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,060
But once I get to those stops, I want to find out what's there.

173
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,960
Can I take a ramp out to the beach?

174
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,220
What do the dunes look like?

175
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,620
What do the panels along the wayside say?

176
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,060
So they are doing this not only for these external sites,

177
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,920
but they are doing this for just regular visitor center museums.

178
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,580
I've done about 15 or 20 National Park sites,

179
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:45,840
anywhere from Carlsbad Caverns to Portsmith Arkansas to the FDR Library in Hyde Park

180
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:54,220
so this is a really ripe site for work in audio description, but the mandate is there from the National Park service.

181
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Local park sites, more and more folks are trying to make their institutions accessible.

182
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,960
I know Naperville just put out a RFP for some of their kiosks and their nature center.

183
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,240
And so these are some of the places where that can happen.

184
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,640
If you go to Millennium Park right now, the ADA 25 Chicago group,

185
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,320
which is sponsored by the Chicago Community Trust,

186
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,968
has put a series of panels along one of the walkways in Millennium Park

187
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:32,000
that talk about the construction of the park, and some of the structures there

188
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,842
and they put up a series of panels that give that information.

189
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:40,662
So If I'm blind or have low vision, I can take my smartphone out, and scan the QR code

190
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:46,100
that takes me to a website that will audio describe the panels and the park itself.

191
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,520
As I mentioned earlier, a lot of people have friends or family who, essentially, function as a personal describer

192
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,678
for folks, they will take them around and tell them what's going on.

193
00:15:59,678 --> 00:16:03,856
But this is also something that would be interesting for a lot of these areas

194
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,060
Whether it's a cultural institution, or a corporate meeting, or a gala.

195
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:16,120
Last year, back up one step. Every year, the Kennedy Center sponsors a conference called

196
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,940
the Leadership Exchange in Arts and Disabilities. L.E.A.D.

197
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:26,000
And they have the conference every year, one year in Washington, the off year in some other U.S. city.

198
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,860
Last summer, that conference was here in Chicago.

199
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,540
And there was a gentleman who was blind from the Irish Theater that I was his personal describer for those

200
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,360
fours days at the conference. So I would take him around to the conference rooms

201
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,440
I would tell him what the food is in front of him at the buffet

202
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,940
I would navigate the space for him and describe any of the slides or materials

203
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,520
that were presented at conference.

204
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:55,800
So that personal description means he could more fully enjoy the content, that content equity

205
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,940
that quality of experience in that particular situation.

206
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,040
Alright, so, let's get a little more into what audio description really is.

207
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:12,348
So this is kind of a quick crash course for y'all in what audio description is.

208
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,320
The first rule is describe what you see

209
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:24,360
One sees physical appearances and actions, one does not see motivations or intentions.

210
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:33,580
So we see that Mary clenches her fists, we do not see that Mary is angry, or worse, that Mary is angry at John.

211
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,400
You can't describe that.

212
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,160
You include the visual information that is inaccessible to people who are blind or have low vision.

213
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,500
These include key plot elements, such as people, places, actions, objects, or unknown sound sources

214
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,140
not mentioned in the dialog or made obvious by what one hears.

215
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,180
Now describing everything is impossible.

216
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,129
You describe first what is essential in the allowable time.

217
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:03,009
As time permits, you describe further elements, such as the decor, details of the settings,

218
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:06,220
the physical appearance and mannerisms of the characters

219
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:14,220
architecture, clothing style, technology, color, light, texture, all those things if you have time you say them

220
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,400
But, descriptions should not fill every pause. Less is more.

221
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,800
Description is not the running commentary.

222
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,720
Listeners should be allowed to hear the emotions in actor's voices

223
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,513
and the tension in the silence between the characters.

224
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,820
Now, when you are in a play, or even in media,

225
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:43,100
it's important to describe seemingly insignificant things that the sighted audience will observe

226
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,560
without knowing their later importance.

227
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:52,440
So for example, you would describe that Mary is toying with a pistol and then places it in a top desk drawer.

228
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,760
So later in the show, when John and Mary are having a heated argument, and Mary edges towards the desk,

229
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,560
the sighted audience will suspect that she's headed for the gun.

230
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,660
But because you've given that information about what she's been doing with the pistol

231
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,980
and where she's placed it, by describing both of those actions,

232
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,460
we've allowed the listener to join in that suspenseful anticipation.

233
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,080
The second rule of audio description is to describe objectively.

234
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,764
Allow listeners to form their own opinions and to draw their own conclusions.

235
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,900
You don't editorialize, interpret, explain, analyze or help listeners in any other way.

236
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:37,438
So for instance, if the conclusion is that the character is angry, we describe what led to that conclusion

237
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,420
Jesters, facial expressions of the character,

238
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:47,620
characters moods, motives or reasoning are not visible and thus not subject to description.

239
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,340
We only use those adjectives and adverbs that do not offer value judgements and that are not themselves

240
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,960
subject to interpretation.

241
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:03,240
So for instance, beautiful says only that something is not ugly. But what exactly makes it beautiful?

242
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,440
Instead of saying the person, clothing or object is beautiful,

243
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,780
describe the things observed that cause your conclusion

244
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,066
so that listeners can draw their own conclusion.

245
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,380
We also use the first person when the director of a show or play has created a first-person point of view

246
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,860
as a means of including the audience.

247
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:31,203
This sensation is part of the experience of sighted audience members and must be shared with listeners.

248
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:38,915
So when a character turns to address the audience, you say "he turns to us" instead of "he turns to the audience."

249
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:40,775
You're not breaking that fourth wall.

250
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,900
"His flashlight shines in our eyes."

251
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,860
With film and video description, the same would apply.

252
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,500
"The shark swims towards us." Not "The shark swims towards the camera."

253
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,594
Or "We moved through the forest." instead of "The camera moves through the forest."

254
00:20:58,162 --> 00:21:00,482
Giving them that same experience.

255
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,160
Next, you want to be sure to allow the listeners to hear the dialog.

256
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,548
Listeners want to hear the performance first, and the description second.

257
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,913
The dialog is telling the story and must be heard.

258
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,520
Now this rule is only broken when the confusion by omitting the description is greater than

259
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,200
maintaining the integraty of the dialog.

260
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:28,551
So as an example, Deborah is talking nonstop about making a pie

261
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:31,271
but she is quietly taking a gun from the drawer.

262
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,320
The describer must speak over her dialog because the audience will hear a gunshot before

263
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,780
she stops talking about making the pie.

264
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,740
The sounds or dialog from a radio, television or other speaking characters may be important to the story

265
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,380
or may be considered background sound.

266
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,005
But if it is background noise, it is permissible to describe over it, assuming the description is vital.

267
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:01,660
However, you don't want to talk over a song played on the radio if its recognition by the audience

268
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,380
or the audience's hearing its content may be important setting a mood,

269
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,820
recalling a hero or making an emotional statement.

270
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,500
We often use short phrases in place of using full sentences.

271
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,360
We try to speak at least two or three words

272
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,320
so listeners have the opportunity to switch focus to the describers voice.

273
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,840
But, unless absolutely necessary, we try not to interrupt with just one word

274
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,800
it's all about the timing.

275
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,860
When you have plenty of time, you can say things like,

276
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,993
"Ken walks across the room, picks up a knife, butters the toast."

277
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
When time is tighter,

278
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,620
"Ken picks up a knife, butters the toast."

279
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,420
When it is extremely tight,

280
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,641
"Ken picks up knife, butters toast."

281
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:53,979
Next, you have to trust the listener's ability to comprehend the material.

282
00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:58,839
In most instances, listeners have made the choice to attend the performance or watch the show

283
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:02,952
so you have to trust them to grasp the meaning of the material and the description.

284
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,300
Don't condescend, patronize or talk down to the listeners

285
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,500
For example, when I describe costumes in a play, where women where bustles

286
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,860
I can confirm that everyone knows what a bustle is by tucking the description into a set of pre-show notes,

287
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,260
with something like "women's long skirts puff out in back,

288
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,160
padded over the hips and under the skirts with bustles."

289
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,641
Then, all you have to do is say the word bustle thereafter while the play is happening

290
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:33,621
you convey the costume during the performance.

291
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,980
If a play has a complex plot or a confusing set of characters,

292
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,320
there's probably information you can share from the playbill

293
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,460
Just as this information is helpful to sighted audience members,

294
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,940
sharing this information with listeners during a set of pre-show notes may aid

295
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,983
their appreciation for the performance and the description.

296
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,300
This can also happen in the form of reading from the playbill.

297
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,780
But it's important to make clear that this information comes from the program

298
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,339
so that listeners understand that everyone has access to this information

299
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:05,039
that I'm not providing them with special information

300
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,380
because they may have verbal bond with the material and they assumed that has happened

301
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,040
I don't want to do that.

302
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,260
Now for many diverse reasons, some people prefer minimal description as opposed to

303
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,160
longer descriptions, as the time allows.

304
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,240
People who are congenially blind or who are born without sight

305
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,900
are often comfortable with the level of information that they gleen from what they routinely hear

306
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,460
and sometimes they don't realize how much visual information is available.

307
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:39,740
On the other hand, people who are adventitiously blind or born with sight and lost it later

308
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,980
know that there is a great amount of visual information and don't want to miss anything.

309
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,829
But it's the describers responsibility to find that medium.

310
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,060
Next, censorship is unfair to the material and the listeners.

311
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:01,100
Describers who censor information because of their own discomfort fail their listeners.

312
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:07,100
Describers must say the factual information such as things as nudity, sexual acts and violence.

313
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,800
Listeners should know everything that is evident to sighted people.

314
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,668
If a describer feels that describing the particular material make him or her feel uncomfortable,

315
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:18,040
he or she should not accept the assignment.

316
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,340
Keep the language consistent.

317
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,800
The describer needs to choose language that is consistent with the content or material.

318
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,366
You need to use language that is appropriate for the listeners.

319
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:36,526
For instance, children's programs, you use vocabulary suitable for the age group.

320
00:25:36,526 --> 00:25:41,040
And remember that they may not have a life experience to know common expressions like

321
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,560
"Catch 22"

322
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,640
You need to make every effort to pronounce words properly.

323
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,200
Actors names, directors, designers, character's names, the names of objects and places.

324
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,021
And once you've established the name with the characters and places and such,

325
00:25:57,021 --> 00:26:00,320
always use that same name.

326
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:06,620
You have to know that not all listeners will understand slang, colloquialisms or regional terms.

327
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,540
Only use those, again, within the context of the performance.

328
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,440
And as I said at the beginning with the definition of audio description,

329
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,720
we only use vivid verbs and descriptive words

330
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,620
People frequently walk, but they also amble, stagger, shuffle, shounder, stroll,

331
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:31,158
all conveying different amounts of emotion, all different physical characteristics.

332
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,840
You choose the words that best matches that action.

333
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,980
Time shifts are another time when it becomes difficult, like flash backs or vision into the future.

334
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:48,820
And in relation to the character, using visual effects may further identify these kind of changes.

335
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,420
So for example, I can say

336
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:56,460
"Lighting shifts to pale amber as George sits next to his sister at the family dinner table."

337
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,000
That change of lighting, queues the listener in on what's going on on stage.

338
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:09,620
Now, people often say to me, "Well, why do I describe colors for people who are blind or have low vision?"

339
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:15,960
Well describing colors is useful, both to help people with low vision to locate what is being described,

340
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,520
because again, its not a homogeneous community

341
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,460
but also to share the emotional meaning of the color in the production.

342
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,717
People who are blind or have low vision usually share those common attributes we assign to color

343
00:27:28,717 --> 00:27:35,037
such as blue and green meaning cool and serene while red and orange are hot and compestuous.

344
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:42,180
Saying the dress is burgundy, rather than the dress is red, more richly describes the dress.

345
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,420
However, you want to avoid unusual color words like cyan ... puce

346
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,180
A corollary to the rule about language consistency concerning vocal tone.

347
00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:00,008
The describer should match their vocal delivery to the pace, energy and volume of the material.

348
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:04,368
You want to allow the performance to set your tone and rhythm of the description

349
00:28:04,368 --> 00:28:08,639
remembering that the performance, not the describer, should be the focus.

350
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:13,788
So just that the describer should not assume a detach, lecturing or a clinical tone,

351
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:22,720
the describer should not attempt to project him or herself into the performance as another performer.

352
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,340
Dramatizing the delivery of the description is distracting, and perhaps insulting,

353
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,432
because the listener may feel the describer is telling them how to respond.

354
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,260
Sighted audience members don't see the character's race, ethnicity or nationality.

355
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,300
Rather, they see skin color and facial features

356
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:55,120
Therefore, the describer should simply describe each person's skin color, and if time allows, facial features.

357
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,540
In a dramatic work, where character's backgrounds develop over time,

358
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,220
the writer, director and actors will help the audience learn where each character fits

359
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,860
into the role of the play or show.

360
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,840
Socioeconomic level, educational level, relationship to the other characters,

361
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,554
so to the extent that some or all of these are important in the storytelling.

362
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:25,740
In a dramatic work or perhaps because of the story or setting, the character's race or ethnicity or nationality

363
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,720
is largely apparent to sighted audience members and integral to the plot

364
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,660
delineating those differences as part of the description would be helpful.

365
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,800
For example, in West Side Story, the plot is much more understandable

366
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,200
if one knows who's a Jet and who's a Shark

367
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,720
and that the Jets are Caucasian and the Sharks are Puerto Rican.

368
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,900
In A Raisin in the Sun, there would be no story without knowing that the primary focus

369
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,660
is an African-American family, and that the antagonist, Karl Lindner, is Caucasian.

370
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,840
And finally, we want to describe from the listener's perspective.

371
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,620
Surprises should ideally come at the same time for all audience members.

372
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,280
If a character's appearance or actions, hidden identity, costumes, sight-gags, or sound effects

373
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,800
happens as a surprise to the sighted audience members, don't spoil the surprise

374
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,720
for the blind or low vision audience by describing or reviewing in advance.

375
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:30,994
Every character is in disguise, he becomes 'the man' rather than 'John wears a disguise.'

376
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:43,180
Now, I need to get out of this; I need to quit Powerpoint and show some demos.

377
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:59,580
So, on my website, which I'll give you at the end, there are a number of videos on the bottom of my AD page that I've described.

378
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:07,780

[AD: The young man smiles.]

454
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,720
So, what's interesting in that, in a couple of instances, I had to say things a little before

455
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,180
...sometimes a little bit after, so the temporal description that I could give

456
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,760
did not exactly match the visual information, but it conveyed the story nonetheless

457
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,200
so you have to be very judicious about where in this type of example.

458
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:08,940
And I have one more piece here, that is more of an educational video.

459
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:17,695
[AD: Long slender body Shark walks across the sea floor rather than swim by wiggling its body and ]

460
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:22,575
[AD: pushing with its pectoral and pelvic fins. Its features include a general brown coloration]

461
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:28,055
[AD: and numerous clusters of mainly two to three polygonal spots, widely scattered white spots ]

462
00:37:28,055 --> 00:37:34,055
[AD: in the matrix between dark clusters, fewer than ten large dark spots on the inter-orbital snout region, ]

463
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:37,515
[AD: and a pair of larger dark marks on the ventral surface of the head.]

464
00:37:37,515 --> 00:37:42,255
[AD: Clamoring over the rough terrain over the seafloor, similar to a baby crawling on its stomach, ]

465
00:37:42,255 --> 00:37:47,415
[AD: the shark forages for food by sticking its snout into the corners, recesses and alcoves ]

466
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:53,215
[AD: of rock and coral formations for any prey which might be hiding there in. Walking sharks, also known as]

467
00:37:53,215 --> 00:38:00,215
[AD: Bamboo sharks, or Long Tail Carpet Sharks, belong to the family Henneselyday, in the shark order ]

468
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,749
[AD: Arectalobelforms ]

469
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,160
Well, that's pretty much what we'll get out of that video.

470
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,471
So these have different purposes, obviously this one would be for instance, a high school zoology

471
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:25,411
educational video, where they're getting information on not only what the shark looks like, what its behaviors

472
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:31,500
and some additional information about the genus and scientific names of the shark.

473
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,540
So it all depends again on your audience, what it is you are trying to convey, whether its entertainment

474
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,900
or if its educational, whether its high school, whether its general population

475
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:48,200
so, those are some ideas as far as the context of what you are trying to do.

476
00:38:49,260 --> 00:39:01,820
I have one more video here, see if I can quit out of Safari. And I'm going to first play a video

477
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,260
a few minutes of a video I did that does not have description.

478
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,760
So you'll first hear the version without description, I"ll play a minute or two of that,

479
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,200
and I'll go back and play the described version. This is the movie as I received it.

480
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:10,280
[Dialog: We share our lives with people. We think we know them. Do we ever really know anyone?]

481
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,820
So, I'm going to pick on you a bit Kelly,

482
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:44,260
what did you get from that? What did you imagine was going on the screen?

483
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:53,360
[Kelly: like in some sort of outdoor place, in maybe a forest or something, but that's about all.]

484
00:41:53,360 --> 00:42:00,460
Yeah, it was really difficult to tell because there was nothing in the dialog to tell me what was going on.

485
00:42:05,448 --> 00:42:09,928
So now I'm going to bring in the described version of that same clip.

486
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,380
So this is now the described version of that movie. It's about ten minutes long.

00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:52,360
[Dialog: We need someone to confirm the identity of the body. We need to make the claim official. It's important.]

583
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,580
[AD: She drops the photo on the coffee table, straightens herself. ]

584
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,460
[Dialog: I'm sorry, I don't believe this.]

585
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,420
[AD: She heads toward the door. McCoy gathers his case and follows her. ]

586
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:08,000
[Dialog: I know this is painful. I really do need to know.]

587
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,900
[Dialog: Look, I can't do this.]

588
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,320
[Dialog: If you change your mind...]

589
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,080
[Dialog: You just don't take no for an answer, do you?]

590
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,760
[Dialog: Here's my card, it's got my cell number on it. Call me anytime. Just take it.]

591
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,000
[Dialog: Thanks for the coffee.]

592
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,660
[AD: He walks out the door. ]

593
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:34,040
[AD: Mrs. Thompson closes the door, and stares down at McCoy’s card in her hand. ]

594
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:47,580
[AD: Later that night, an interior door bangs gently in the wind next to glass vase filled with daffodils. ]

595
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,100
[AD: In candlelight, Mrs. Thompson sits on a couch in her pajamas, hair down.]

596
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,420
[AD:  A jazz record plays on a turntable. ]

597
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,980
[AD: She leafs through an old scrapbook filled with pictures and mementos of her husband.]

598
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,420
[AD: She turns the page to a picture of Leonard.]

599
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,160
[AD: Her fingers trail across the page. ]

600
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:20,560
[AD: On the facing page, a newspaper clipping reads: “Office Building Burns; Man Dies.” ]

601
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,840
[AD: She wipes away something in her eye. ]

602
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:41,200
[AD: She turns the page. Another headline reads, “Widow Cleared of Charges, Money Still Missing.”]

603
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,820
[AD: She starts, twisting around to see the door has knocked over the flower vase. ]

604
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,240
[AD: She steps over to the mess, and moves to get a cloth. ]

605
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:12,060
[AD: Stepping carefully around the broken glass, she kneels down and picks up the flowers from the floor, ]

606
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,348
[AD: placing them gently in the cloth. ]

607
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:20,020
[AD: Walking past Leonard’s half-draped portrait, clutching the flowers and cloth in her arms, ]

608
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,300
[AD: she stops short. ]

609
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:28,740
[AD: She stares at the painting, breathing deeply, then turns her head, and walks away. ]

610
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,520
Questions about that?

611
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,760
[Audience: Actually, it looks like you have one. ]

612
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,200
Oh, I"m sorry, yes...

613
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,599
[Audience: I have a lot of questions. So you had some value judgements to make. ]

614
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,650
[Audience: Me hear the door close, you chose to say that's the door closing. ]

615
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:00,490
[Audience: Are there other times when you say, maybe I don't have to say the door is closing?]

616
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,190
Yes.

617
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,660
[Audience: It also sounds like there are times where you are recording at one pace]

618
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,854
[Audience: but you were speeding up using words or something ...]

619
00:52:08,854 --> 00:52:10,494
Not at all. It's just all in my vocal.

620
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,640
[Audience: We just ask that you repeat the question.]

621
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

622
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:22,240
So there was one question about the choice when to mention that the door was opening or closing.

623
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,760
That was a choice on my part as a describer.

624
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:32,880
And then as far as the pacing of my voice, I did not use any pro tools or any other effects.

625
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,020
Yes, Mark.

626
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:43,705
[Audience: Do you user test this stuff before you release it to the public, like is it tested on an audience]

627
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:47,485
[Audience: and then they say, well, we're really not getting this part of it?]

628
00:52:47,485 --> 00:52:52,139
Generally, that does not happen. It does happen when I do National Park sites.

629
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:58,095
So when I've written a script before its recorded for presentation for a user to carry around

630
00:52:58,095 --> 00:53:02,912
they will want to read everything that I have written and that they have the opportunity to

631
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:08,360
comment on whether if this is not clear or I missed that part, those kind of things.

632
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:14,685
In that sense, those things do get tested and then obviously the description comes out that much better

633
00:53:14,685 --> 00:53:17,100
when you have audience participation.

634
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:25,640
Now, that also can bring up some additional variances in people's appreciation or expectation

635
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:31,820
of what the description is since there's no certification for describers, there are trainings.

636
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,780
I was trained by the American Council for the Blind and also at the Kennedy Lead Conference,

637
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:39,480
they had a workshop that I participated in

638
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:46,440
People's delivery and choices are their own delivery and choices so

639
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,760
one describer is not going to describe it the same way like another

640
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,940
and there's no way to say there is one true way to make it happen.

641
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,660
[Audience: The only thing I wanted to ask is...]

642
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:00,300
[Audience: clearly, this kind of work that you are doing in terms of film and commercials is scripted.]

643
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:07,680
[Audience: but you also do live work. What do you find more challenging, or ... you know what I'm getting at]

644
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,020
[Audience: what is your favorite kind of work to do?]

645
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:14,680
Right, so the question is, there's description for video where it is scripted, the television shows,

646
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:19,800
and then there's live description, which do I personally find more appealing?

647
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,840
[Audience: Or challenging?}

648
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,360
Or challenging? So it's definitely challenging to do things live

649
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:30,120
So for instance, there are many different live situations

650
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:35,381
The situation where I was a personal describer for the person at the LEAD conference.

651
00:54:35,381 --> 00:54:39,620
I would just say things to him as we walked along or just sat there

652
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:46,940
I didn't have to worry so much about stepping on people's dialog or a story being told

653
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:52,557
As a presenter, that situation, that was slides, they would pause, I would describe what was in the slides

654
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,000
and so on and so forth.

655
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:59,580
Doing a show, live, like a dolphin show or a bird show, there is a narrator talking

656
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:07,840
as well as the actions of the birds, and so I have a script laid out in front of me with things I can say

657
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:13,520
but, it's really, I'm trying to find that place I can say it.

658
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:19,520
Now, invariably, you step on people's lines in that situation.

659
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:26,660
If I'm doing a play, I also script the play, and I see it two or three times and I often work with a video of the play

660
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,633
before I do an actual performance.

661
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:35,120
So in that case, I get a really good sense of where those pauses are, but, from one night to the next,

662
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,560
the actors may change their pacing, they may step on each others lines, they may move things around,

663
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,700
they may skip a scene entirely.

664
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:47,420
So I actually prefer that live performance because it's a performance for myself as well.

665
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:54,820
This is much more technical, for a video or TV show, because the gaps and the pauses don't ever change.

666
00:55:54,820 --> 00:56:01,700
I can find a video, I have to review it, I know what kinds of things I need to point out,

667
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:08,460
For instances if the door banging in the wind

668
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:15,900
next to the flower vase, had I not said that it was next to the flower vase, when the flower vase crashed and broke

669
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:23,040
it would be an unfamiliar or unexpected noise for the blind or low vision consumer.

670
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:29,040
So I need to make sure that I, as I was talking about my presentation, I kind of preface that,

671
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,180
so when that happens, Ah, the door knocked over the vase.

672
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:38,100
I say that, true, to reinforce it, and then she goes and cleans it up. Those kind of things.

673
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:46,960
[Audience: You're staffing up, and have a thousand resumes, are you looking for a fiction writer,

674
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,280
a journalist, someone who has an improve background?

675
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,360
I'm looking for someone who have audio description training.

676
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,340
There is no one particular background that, where audio describers excel.

677
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:05,100
It could be architects, it could be writers, painters, but it's important that they get training, because you can

678
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:10,060
you can do a bad job at this kind of thing, even with best intentions

679
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:14,886
but following the guidelines, and these were from the audio description collation,

680
00:57:14,886 --> 00:57:20,800
and I have a list of resources from websites and URLs where I got a lot of this material at the end

681
00:57:20,806 --> 00:57:25,040
But there's no one particular profile that would make a great audio describer.

682
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,900
[Audience: Except a great set of pipes]

683
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,940
[Laughter]

684
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,874
Sell, so, it's interesting that you mention that.

685
00:57:31,874 --> 00:57:33,771
So, I'm a writer and a voicer.

686
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,980
I'm a voice actor, but I also write description.

687
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,533
Now, the real craft of this, and the real art of it is writing description.

688
00:57:41,533 --> 00:57:43,673
And you can get anyone to read it.

689
00:57:43,673 --> 00:57:50,296
So that's what often happens on these described tours, I will go to a facility, I will write the described tour

690
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,197
but I may not necessarily voice it. They may be subcontracted out to someone else to read.

691
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,800
So, it depends on what the situation is.

692
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,860
But the real skill is actually in the writing. I just happen to do both.

693
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,280
Kelly, do you have any comments on the description itself?

694
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,580
You, being our sole blind or low vision member? How did I do?

695
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:23,041
[Kelly: Oh, you did well. Although, I wondered, sort of perhaps, with the describers, including yourself,]

696
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:34,540
[Kelly: Is, particularly considering yourself a voice actor and performer, the description is so emotionless ]

697
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:43,520
[Kelly: it almost takes away from the scene itself.]

698
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:56,900
[Kelly: because the audio describer isn't conveying the emotions  present in the scene that we are experiencing]

699
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:01,900
[Kelly: you know, in the case of a dramatic presentation]

700
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:09,520
So that's a balance as well, and as I mentioned some of my rules and guidelines of description,

701
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:15,040
Describers are not really supposed to be part of the performance. They are there to

702
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,500
describe the performance that's happening but not be another performer in the expression.

703
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:24,780
But, it does happen. When I do plays, and I tried to do that in this last scene too,

704
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:31,420
where she is very contentively leaving through her photo album, but

705
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:37,320
I tried to be a little softer in tone, a little bit more slow in my delivery at times.

706
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,680
But obviously, that didn't come across to you.

707
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:45,620
[Kelly: It didn't seem to have a lot of empathy to the characters.]

708
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:51,220
[Kelly: I guess that's why I was more suggesting as compared to actual conveying the emotions ]

709
00:59:51,220 --> 01:00:00,240
[Kelly: of the experience. But sharing the empathy that's being created in the dramatic work.]

710
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,177
[Kelly: Obviously, that's not necessary in a thirty or sixty second commercial.]

711
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:16,420
[Kelly: But in this longer piece, music and the characters and their emotions and how they're being portrayed]

712
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:26,700
[Kelly: it would seem natural the audio describer would be coordinating with that sort of thing ]

713
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:35,760
[Kelly: as compared to almost sounding like a doctor, like being an operation or procedure.]

714
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:42,380
There's quite a bit of debate about that, and different people have different emotional reactions to

715
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:47,660
audio description. Some people do not like the describers to have any emotion at all.

716
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:53,660
Other people would like a little more matching tone, matching emotion to the scene.

717
01:00:53,660 --> 01:01:02,120
So it really ... there's different impressions, and different expectations about what that should be.

718
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,460
[Kelly: I understand. We're having this question right now in the area of journalism, for example.]

719
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:14,100
[Kelly: Different broadcast networks have different directions, so... ]

720
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:26,780
I've been in conferences where, there have been a large number of people who are blind or low vision

721
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:31,771
and their impressions and desires for description and their preferences are all over the map.

722
01:01:33,217 --> 01:01:38,417
So, I'm not saying this is the only way to do description. This is the way I do it.

723
01:01:38,417 --> 01:01:42,897
But it's always a work in progress, so I appreciate your feedback.

724
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,760
Well, you've all been very patient, I appreciate that very much.

725
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,100
I have a couple more slides here.

726
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:27,440
I'm just going to end now. I have another slide here, I was going to talk here about how

727
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:31,720
audio description relates to Universal Design. I'll be happy to talk to anyone about that.

728
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:39,400
I now have a slide on the screen that are some resource URLs.

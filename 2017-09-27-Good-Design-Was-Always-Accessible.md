The Chicago Digital Accessibility & Inclusive Design Meetup presents Good Design Was Always Accessible, with Sharlene King.

[Sharlene]: So, I'm Sharlene, and today, we're going to talk a little bit about three examples on design and accessibility.

So, before we get started though, I wanted to talk about the baseline definition for design disability. I am going to be using a lot of quotes from an interview someone had with Charles and Ray Eames, who are very famous designers, furniture designers. And I think there are a lot of different definitions around design, right? So, we're going to start off with design [indecipherable].

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,380
It is a job that is supposed to serve a purpose.

12
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,600
And like design, there is also a lot of definitions of disability in the world.

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,240
Lots of organizations have different definitions.

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,720
We're going to go with the social model of disability, which is the idea that,

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,300
every ability you have is really kind of temporary.

16
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,220
Our bodies are just [indecipherable] as I like to say.

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,140
We are all vulnerable to impairments, whether its spraining your wrist, developing a disease,

18
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,520
being born with something that changes the way you interact with the world.

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,460
And disability is what happens when the world excludes you for that difference,

20
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,380
as opposed to just viewing you as a medical [indecipherable].

21
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:02,720
These are two of my favorite quotes, Brad Frost, he is one of the biggest mobile first developers.

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,780
And then Stella Young is a comedian who is a disability rights activist.

23
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,740
I think this highlights what social, the social model of disability means.

24
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,220
You know, if I'm with a wheelchair user, and we are crossing a street,

25
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,360
[Indecipherable] a problem, we can both do that.

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,120
If we encounter stairs, that's when the wheelchair user is disabled.

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,340
And, to be honest, as someone with Asthma,  there's only so many stairs I can climb.

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:43,520
And with each set of stairs, that list grows longer, of who can, or cannot make that journey.

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,380
So today, we'll talk lots about history.

30
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,660
We will not be talking about best practices.

31
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,820
These are going to be observations of things that have happened in history

32
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,200
so, think of them as neutral ... value neutral.

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,180
Neither good nor bad, they are just things that have happened.

34
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,240
So, our first section, which is about function and design.

35
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,940
So, Charles and Ray Eames asked, is design constraints?

36
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,840
Design is largely dependent on constraints, meaning ...

37
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,720
without constraints, there's really not much to design, you're just throwing things together.

38
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,880
And there's probably nothing more symbolic and recognizable in the world

39
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,880
for a sign of disability, than the wheelchair.

40
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,220
It's a universal icon.

41
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,720
Without irony, before the past hundred years, wheelchairs were actually a luxury item.

42
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,440
In the 1800's, they were used as ... were called Bath Chairs.

43
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,100
So literally, rich people using them because they didn't feel like walking at the spa.

44
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,140
On the French Court, they were also called Roulettes.

45
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,180
You won't find much about that because people Google roulette, and you'll get gambling.

46
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,240
But yeah ...

47
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,160
It was an issue of labor.

48
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,460
They didn't expect people who needed wheelchairs to be able to use them on their own,

49
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,840
so it was limited to the wealthy, who could afford people to run around with them.

50
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,740
This all changed after the end of World War 1.

51
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,220
And there was a really good reason for that.

52
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,780
You suddenly had lots of people surviving their injuries because of medical advances.

53
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,500
But those medical advances did not prevent these soldiers from becoming disabled.

54
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:59,460
When you talk about losing over 2 percent of your population, you need to keep anybody who can work.

55
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,040
Not just people who can work ideally, but anyone.

56
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,100
So, instead of using heavy prosthetics,

57
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,300
the Queen of England charged people with developing the aluminum prosthetic.

58
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,860
And as you can see, it came in many different shapes and sizes,

59
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,280
but they were all geared towards labor.

60
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,400
And they also had an extensive vocational  program across England

61
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,000
so disabled soldiers could pick up a trade when they came home.

62
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm talking about Britain, because in the US, we were not so good about that.

63
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:46,100
In the US, the government was not prepared for the amount of people who came back from war disabled.

64
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,720
They didn't have jobs. And then, the Great Depression hit.

65
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,280
So, the money that disabled veterans were promised,

66
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,560
was suddenly not available.

67
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,020
They formed a camp outside of D.C. known as, the bonus army, Hooverville.

68
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,080
These kind of shanty towns were so common, they were named after the President who failed to prevent them.

69
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,500
43 thousand people lived there.

70
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,100
It wasn't just the veterans, who would march on D.C., but their families, too.

71
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,480
And when the President decided to remove them,

72
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,540
he used the actual army, General MacArthur came in with six tanks,

73
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,980
and over a thousand people were injured during the process.

74
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,880
Three people died, one of them was a baby.

75
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,340
That was not very popular.

76
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,980
So, but while that was happening, in Germany, you had the Bauhaus School of Design, developing.

77
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,820
You had Mies Van der Rohe,

78
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,340
Marcel Breuer, they were designing all these chairs

79
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,640
you probably see around Chicago a lot in waiting rooms.

80
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,900
This one is the MR Chair.

81
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,280
They also started developing all sorts of buildings.

82
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,400
There's probably nothing more recognizable

83
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,740
than a Mies Van Der Rohe building in Chicago

84
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,600
because he ended up becoming the director of architecture down at IIT.

85
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,140
He was also considered a valuable refugee.

86
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,100
So many of Germany's best designers were able to come to America

87
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,600
and influence the design here.

88
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,780
And in 1932, that was when the first foldable wheelchair was invented.

89
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:47,060
If you really look at it structurally, ignoring what historical baggage we have,

90
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,820
it's not too different in structure and make from that very expensive chair designed by Mies Van Der Rohe.

91
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,740
If we compare them side-by-side, the Wassily Chair and a Wassily Chair adapted as a wheelchair,

92
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,400
I'm not sure there's a lot of functional difference besides one has wheels.

93
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,960
Now on to form. So form is a very big part of design too.

94
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,380
It is one of our most obvious constraints, right?

95
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,960
And I think Eams, there are a couple, but the way, they said it best,

96
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,720
we don't have compromises, we have constraints.

97
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,160
The compromise is simply when you say the constraint doesn't matter.

98
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,520
Or, we don't need to acknowledge it, we don't need to work with it.

99
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,900
So, you have two designers, they're working full time jobs,

100
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,340
and they make this weird machine in their apartment on the weekends.

101
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,340
It's called the Kazam!

102
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,360
The exclamation point is very important.

103
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,820
And it molds plywood.

104
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
They also have a friend in the military.

105
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,980
He's a doctor and he mentions that, oh, these aluminum splints we have,

106
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,960
they kind of hurt our soldiers more than help.

107
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,920
As you can see how it's constructed, it's not really going to help someone who's got half a leg blown off.

108
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,120
And it vibrates, that was the biggest problem.

109
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,180
The way aluminum vibrates, it's very stiff.

110
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,560
Even cyclists will tell you that they would rather ride steel versus aluminum because of the vibrations.

111
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:49,240
So they actually ended up designing this molded wood splint.

112
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,420
And the cool thing about it was because it was pressed, it could have punch holes for things like bandages.

113
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,060
And unlike the aluminum splint, it could be easily be molded to the contours of your muscles.

114
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,820
At that time, it was very difficult to mass produce aluminum that way.

115
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,380
Aluminum as mass production wasn't really an invention until the 70's, 80's,

116
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,280
and this was in the early 50's,

117
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,560
as people returned home from World War 2.

118
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:29,280
And there is probably not a single piece of furniture today more associated with affluent designers.

119
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,500
The Eames Lounger.

120
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,320
That shape of the molded plywood

121
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,360
able to contour the shape to anybody

122
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,880
including the Eames chair, all of those techniques were perfected while Eames was designing that splint.

123
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,840
But then a side thing happened.

124
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,580
Just like today, as then, tastes changed.

125
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,860
We started seeing homes being proliferated with these sleek, wooden designs.

126
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,960
The Eames chair feels really comfortable and warm there, doesn't it?

127
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,760
Hospitals kept using that tubular chrome that we saw from Bauhaus.

128
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,320
It was affordable.

129
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,140
The chairs you're sitting on right now are using it,

130
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,300
because it can be cheaply mass produced

131
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,160
and is modular.

132
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,520
What happens? People started associating that very design element that was once cool,

133
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,820
with institutions, and being disabled.

134
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,040
So, need. That's the other part of design.

135
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,720
That's part of the job.

136
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,800
All of those constraints around form and function,

137
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,380
cannot ... there is no direction without trying to figure out what the need is behind the design.

138
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,780
So, one of the things I want to make clear, because by this point,

139
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,160
you may think I'm saying the military is an advocate for disability ... they're not.

140
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:19,580
Just like developers back in the early teens and late ots weren't advocates for Internet Explorer Six.

141
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,660
[Laughter]

142
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,160
{Sharlene]: We just had to accommodate them.

143
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,440
You couldn't say, yeah, screw five percent of our users.

144
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,460
No  product manager would accept that, would they?

145
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
It was a force of integration.

146
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,840
Not awareness.

147
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,080
And that's a really big difference between integration and assimilation,

148
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,780
which is what we're going to talk about next with fulfilling need.

149
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,440
Now assimilation, a big chunk of it is, trying to disguise and hide something.

150
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,960
You know, Theodore Roosevelt's favorite pair of glasses was something called the Pince-nez.

151
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
As you can see, it doesn't even have a frame.

152
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:13,140
It's just literally two pieces of glasses, held together with a piece of metal, pinched on his nose bridge.

153
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,660
He can put it away, it's not meant to be seen, it's not a statement, it's just discreetly a visual aid.

154
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,480
In 1942, thanks to the invention of polarized glass,

155
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,340
you can now have sunglasses.

156
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:38,260
And the military saw sunglasses, not as a fashion statement, but as an advanced technology.

157
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,600
Their pilots had an advantage over other pilots, because they didn't have to deal with sun glare.

158
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,800
And that meant, you could wear glasses that weren't medical.

159
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,000
At this point, prescription glasses were still classified as a medical appliance.

160
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,240
Simply having a little bit of myopia meant you were disabled.

161
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,520
And then 1978 happened.

162
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,000
By then, so many different types of plastics and materials had been developed.

163
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,200
Fashion was also getting really wild back then.

164
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:22,220
But also, this is something really strange, because glasses were classified as medical appliances,

165
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,960
it was illegal to make advertisements for them.

166
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,620
I don't know about you, but there's very few things I can think of

167
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,280
that can be popularized without advertisements, without familiarity.

168
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,100
So, Cutler and Gross, they hand-make glasses, even today

169
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,160
printed the first advertisement for prescription glasses.

170
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,920
You might remember Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.

171
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:01,720
Or, if you've ever read the book, he became iconic for the consumption of the 80's.

172
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,560
Well, Oliver Peoples was one of the brands he mentioned, right?

173
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,840
All their ads were conceptual and they were considered high fashion.

174
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,480
By the 90's, it was now ... it reached counter culture.

175
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,080
I don't think you can really, safely say something is embedded in culture,

176
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,600
so there is a counter culture around it.

177
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,980
Kurt Cobain proudly wore glasses. He wore women's sunglasses.

178
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,260
Lisa Loeb popularized the cat-eye glasses.

179
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,380
Christian Slater is just a handsome dude from that time period.

180
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,600
[Laughter]

181
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,620
It's to the point now where one out of five pairs of prescription eye frames

182
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,460
did not have prescriptions in them.

183
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,460
75% of the U.S. needs some sort of corrective lens,

184
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,120
whether it is contact lenses or bifocals or even just the negative positive adjusters

185
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,780
you could buy for reading at a grocery store,

186
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,760
75% of us needs something like that.

187
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,140
But nobody would think that ... medium or impaired reading glasses makes you disabled.

188
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,820
But that's what integration is.

189
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:38,260
It's when ... instead of it being something that where trying to disguise, it is a value neutral aspect of yourself.

190
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,360
You know? Having blond hair is not good or bad.

191
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
Um ... that may be arguable ...

192
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,000
And so, in that interview with Charles and Ray Eames,

193
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,100
the final question is, what is the future of Design? And they never answered it.

194
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,140
And you know, like, I'm kind of positioning that with us.

195
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:11,220
I think it's pretty clear, even just in three examples, that if you recognize and meet this socially,

196
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
and you don't stigmatize it,

197
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,240
the function and form follows very easily

198
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,920
and it doesn't compromise the design.

199
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,860
All of those designs were iconic.

200
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,000
You know?

201
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,680
Where's the individuality?

202
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,060
Like, that was another reason why eyeglasses became so popular.

203
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,580
They defined an individual, whereas the wheelchair, handed out in the hundreds and thousands,

204
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,220
worked identical from the Army.

205
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,540
So, yeah, that's it.

206
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,460
[Applause]

207
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,900
[Dennis]: We're going to open it up to questions.

208
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,980
I do want to ... two things.

209
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,580
I'm going to hand you a mic, if you have questions, and I ask that you repeat it for the live stream.

210
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,600
[Sharlene]: Sure.

211
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
[Dennis]: With that said, questions?

212
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Don't be bashful ...

213
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,500
Yes ... oh, I have to remind myself ...

214
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,820
[Attendee]: Thank you. I was wondering if you could maybe just talk a little bit about

215
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:42,800
your work at Morningstar and  ... [indecipherable]

216
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,900
[Sharlene]: So the question was,

217
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:54,100
how did my working at Morningstar lead me to my interest in accessible design?

218
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,960
I got most of it? Okay [Laugh]

219
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:04,340
So, the cool thing about Morningstar is, design is one of the main tenants, right?

220
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,320
So, from the top down, design is valued, you know?

221
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,440
We've always had a Chief Creative Officer.

222
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,420
We ...  through and through, design thinking is applied at the business level.

223
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,880
And one of the things for us is, we want to help the individual investor.

224
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,020
That is also a core part of our mission, right?

225
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:35,600
And you just can't think of yourself as helping people if you're able to say, well ...

226
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,040
we don't have to worry about 2% people here.

227
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:45,400
You know, as opposed to trying to get more money, since we focus on research,

228
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:53,000
we're not thinking of gains, we're thinking of providing that research to s many people as possible.

229
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,300
Our website is definitely not ... [chuckle] ...double A accessible.

230
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,560
But ...

231
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,060
[Dennis]: Yet

232
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,060
[Sharlene]: we're working on it, yes! We're working on it.

233
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,860
You know, it's hard to do that with a platform from 1996.

234
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,200
[Laughter]

235
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
[Sharlene]: Speaking of old things ...

236
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,400
You know, it's just being in an environment where you feel like people want to care.

237
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:31,000
I think it leads to interest in things where at other jobs, I was pressured to kind of put it on the back burner.

238
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,620
[Dennis]: Ok, any other questions?

239
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:54,400
[Attendee]: If you had the power or ability to change the way that accessibility is handled in the United States,

240
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:01,540
what would you do to make the standards for websites more accessible?

241
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:13,140
[Sharlene]: Yes, so, if I had the power to change anything in the U.S. regarding accessibility

242
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,360
in websites, what would I do? Okay ...

243
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,440
So, I would probably just have people drop the stigma of being disabled as bad.

244
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
You know, if I had any power.

245
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:34,920
Because often, it's just ... I'm reminded when I first started doing web stuff, right?

246
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,240
I'm at an office, an agency,

247
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,060
they're working on their web site, they make this blog

248
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,100
and the header image is 500 kilobytes.

249
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,780
This is 2007, so 500 kilobytes was a lot.

250
00:21:53,780 --> 00:22:00,260
And I pointed it out. I said, you know, this is a really big image, I don't think this is a good idea.

251
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,460
And their answer was like ... their answer was,

252
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,700
we don't want the business of anyone who doesn't have Internet fast enough for that image.

253
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,760
So, I said ... no iPhone users?

254
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:20,620
Because iPhones had just come out, and they used 2G if you remember.

255
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,960
And they used 2G when they were at the airport.

256
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,880
So you're saying you don't want the CEO with an iPhone who's at the airport just reading your blog

257
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,780
and catching up on things.

258
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,520
That, you know ... that really pissed off the Creative Director,

259
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,460
because saying that in front of other stakeholders,

260
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,060
he's embarrassed. What can you say to that?

261
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,080
And yeah, that is not the same thing as saying

262
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,020
what if someone has dyslexia, what is someone has a visual impairment?

263
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:03,840
But I don't see how Internet speed and an image, an unnecessary, garesly large image,

264
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,520
doesn't impact the content you are consuming across different disabilities.

265
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,220
I just made that obstacle relatable to them.

266
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,780
So, stigma.

267
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
[Dennis]: Any other questions? Yes, in the back ...

268
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,580
We're actually thankful for the people in the back with questions.

269
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,900
Because it allows us to get our steps in.

270
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,320
[Laughter]

271
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:41,080
[Attendee]: Thank you for this great presentation. I'm not a designer, so ... [indecipherable]

272
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,920
My question is more about

273
00:23:45,540 --> 00:24:37,860
[Indecipherable]

274
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,480
[Sharlene]: So I think that is a great question.

275
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,080
Is there a way to make accessibility,

276
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,320
or are there resources that make accessibility more readily accessible

277
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,100
for the average person?

278
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:01,980
[Indecipherable]

279
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,840
Fox News, New York Times, and the Washington Post.

280
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,340
[Laugh]

281
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,700
And that isn't for the lack of money. It's cause they're cheap.

282
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:19,100
Often times when people try to make things really fancy, especially in web development,

283
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,140
they inadvertently make it much less accessible.

284
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,940
The simplest website, where you just have text ...

285
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,460
if I made a website that looked like this slide,

286
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,680
any screen reader could read it, no problem.

287
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:39,480
Throw in a lot of buttons and interactive infographics and photos with links and carousels and suddenly ...

288
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,240
that's a nightmare for a screen reader, unless everything is perfectly labelled,

289
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,160
and setup.

290
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,920
But, to resources, that's why, like, to answer the other question, I thought,

291
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,760
the best wish for me would be to drop the stigma.

292
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,960
Because, if you just consider, like ...

293
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,820
making things less difficult.

294
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,160
If you make things better to use,

295
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,320
unlike the fancy stuff, that inadvertently makes things more accessible.

296
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,280
You know, just having the big room here on the ground floor,

297
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,400
if someone wanted to get in here, and they had mobility issues,

298
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,640
then going to the third floor.

299
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,200
Stuff like that, you know.

300
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,200
And whether or not that's because you want to make more money,

301
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,560
that gets more attention than a store that is a flight up.

302
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,660
But ...

303
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,340
Whatever your motivation, the more considerate you are of other's needs

304
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,280
you know, you don't need the fancy book with the checklist,

305
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
passing standards, you know,

306
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,920
to make a website good, you just need to think, oh ...

307
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,860
is this cool? Do I want this just 'cause it's cool, or is it easier to use?

308
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,860
We were just taking about that earlier, me and Dennis, about slides.

309
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,140
My slides are always ...

310
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,500
... black, because , when I've coded, black hurts my eyes less.

311
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,100
It just also happens to pass contrast ratios for accessibility.

312
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:31,300
But by just saying, hey, black text on white screens hurts, let's not do that.

313
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,500
You know, whereas with other presenters, Dennis has had to work with them,

314
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,960
but they don't like the contrast

315
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,060
It's like, okay cool, you don't like the way it looks,  but an people see your slides?

316
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,800
[Dennis]: I'd like to just tack on to that ...

317
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:56,460
[Indecipherable]

318
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,620
... dark backgrounds, white content, for a couple of reasons.

319
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:06,120
1. We've actually received feedback from individuals who've attended our events and said

320
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,520
you know, the white background, it's glaring, it hurts my eyes.

321
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:21,120
Well, if you think of it, why would anyone ... [indecipherable]

322
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,380
I've had a couple individuals who've come up to me and say, that hurts my eyes.

323
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,020
And, you know, the last thing I want to do is to hurt people to show up to our events.

324
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:50,960
So, I've actually guided presenters, to try to inform them ... indecipherable

325
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,680
... so you say ok, that was done for accessibility, but what about inclusiveness?

326
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:05,220
We record ... right now, we're streaming ... to, believe it or not, we have a member in Katmandu, Nepal.

327
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,560
I kid you not. I was so jazzed when I saw that.

328
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:18,780
But, we stream this, and we record this. And we add the slides, so it's easier to see.

329
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,380
And we'll add in the captions and such.

330
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,320
But, this is much easier to see

331
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:35,000
than if it were bright ... we had Marcy Sutton, who's an accessibility engineer and developer

332
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,200
with Deque, it's an accessibility firm, and she had white background,

333
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,000
slides, and it was just a glare.

334
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,960
And I felt so bad, so I had to take her slides and actually incorporate them into the edited recording.

335
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,040
But, the people on the stream, they said, yeah, I can't see anything.

336
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,780
So they basically  ... what she was saying.

337
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,200
[Sharlene]: They invested this, for that purpose.

338
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,300
They literally ...

339
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:04,940
[Laughter]

340
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:10,580
They invested this because bright hurts people's eyes, and then they can't do their thing.

341
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,380
So, that's why I jumped back into this slide.

342
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,280
[Dennis]: Any other questions?

343
00:30:25,580 --> 00:31:06,740
[Attendee]: I just wanted to follow-up with what you were saying about standards ... indecipherable ...

344
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,540
[Sharlene]: Yeah, that's a good question.

345
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:15,180
So, how do I choose between customizing a feature versus using an out-of-the-box,

346
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:20,320
native kind of browser solution, right?

347
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
The answer is ...

348
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,980
It depends on ... what my team ...

349
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:32,540
Because, you know, it's not just being considerate of other people,

350
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,680
but developers, when they customize something like a scrollback,

351
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,280
oh my god, how much time are we going to add to it?

352
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,140
[Pointing to an attendee] She's rolling her eyes!

353
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,800
Yeah, and I'm really greedy with my time.

354
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,980
I want to be able to design fast, and design more.

355
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,960
And if the developers take longer to build something,

356
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,740
that means less of my work gets to see reality.

357
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,440
You know?

358
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,200
So that's just ... it's being considerate from multiple angles.

359
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,800
And then, you know, let's say ...

360
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,260
they give the all clear, they're like, yeah, go ahead and customize the hell out of it.

361
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,380
I've actually been working on something at work.

362
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:25,020
It's a card, so it's a little setup of how you sell a strategy, right?

363
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:31,660
You know, it's pretty easy to think of that for products, like a t-shirt or a spoon, you know.

364
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,640
There's a photo of said thing, and then you have the details about it, you pick your size, add to cart.

365
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,740
It's a little more complicated for financial strategy.

366
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:48,160
So, yeah, it's been fun trying to figure out how to make this

367
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,080
communicate complex information very quickly in just one little snapshot.

368
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,640
So user testing, just asking people who don't have a financial background,

369
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,940
when you look at this, what do you think this text up here means?

370
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,400
We've actually had people say exactly what we wanted them to say.

371
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,620
We've had people get confused, because something was just, out of the way, weird.

372
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,940
You know, and ... listening to them is really how we drive the decisions.

373
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:24,240
There are a lot of things, you know ... I wanted to do, as a designer.

374
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,380
And, if the user says hey, it doesn't make sense,

375
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,020
I'm compelled to drop it.

376
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,380
The design isn't my baby, you know.

377
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,060
And if they don't use it, it's a bad design whether I think it looks nice or not.

378
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,260
[Dennis]: I am so happy to hear you say that the design is not my baby.

379
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,100
That is so contrary to a lot of people that I've heard.

380
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,400
We actually have a question from the Twitterverse ...

381
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,340
[Sharlene]: Oh, okay.

382
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,140
[Dennis]: I'm so excited.

383
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,900
This is from Anna, I believe from Austin, Texas.

384
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,920
She asks, how would you make accessibility go mainstream,

385
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:09,880
like easy steps, some simple accessibility settings, everyone, most people would love?

386
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,380
[Sharlene]: So, there are two ways that I feel people respond to accessibility.

387
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,640
There's making it seem cool, right?

388
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,660
You know, like the iPod, the iPhone.

389
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:28,600
The iPhone did amazing things for accessible, smart technology.

390
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,220
PDAs were not very good before the iPhone.

391
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,160
But, then there's also, like, solving for pain points.

392
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,480
You know, like ...

393
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,020
I can't think of a single person that likes Microsoft Word.

394
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,280
For a million reasons.

395
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,160
Designers hate it because we can't control the text.

396
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,720
People hate it because it's so busy up there.

397
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:59,500
And when you want to do just one little thing, you have to like Google search for like, a half an hour to find that

398
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,940
exactly how to do that thing, and ... wait, no, that didn't do the thing I wanted.

399
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
And then, you start over again, and ...

400
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:13,540
when you make something accessible, those kind of things, the pain points, just drop away.

401
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,980
People will pay any amount of money to fix pain points.

402
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,360
You know ...

403
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,200
My partner really likes her Macbook Pro.

404
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,760
{laugh]

405
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,480
I'm partial to saving money.

406
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,960
PCs, though,

407
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,540
PCs are not as intuitive, the OS is Mac.

408
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
There are different accessibility levels.

409
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,020
But, just because it's simpler to use the Mac

410
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,040
she's willing to drop that money for the Mac. And I can't fault her for that, that's ...

411
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,860
the whole purpose of my job.

412
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,240
My job exists because people are willing to do that.

413
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,640
And when it's not about money, you know, there's also things like ...

414
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,300
like, people I think joke a lot about social media drives vanity.

415
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Instagram likes, Facebook likes ...

416
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,460
but the thing is, vanity is sometimes just a confirmation you're doing things right.

417
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,020
You know?

418
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,300
And, if you're removing pain points,

419
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,020
in different ways, even if it's just like, speaking up for people who

420
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,880
don't normally get spoken up for, or

421
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,940
helping them be more visible, that's even better.

422
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,140
You get recognized for it. You will.

423
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,100
I think people are worried that there's only one way to getting that recognition and that's profit.

424
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,400
But, I think we would be mistaken.

425
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,040
[Dennis]: Any more questions?

426
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:10,080
[Attendee]: I was wondering if you had any tips for having taking the stigma out of conversations

427
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,260
on an organizational level or ... indecipherable ... ?

428
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,460
Because I tend to see two things.

429
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:25,900
Either we get there because we say we're gonna get sued, but there's no emotional compassion at all,

430
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:39,440
or, they're there, but its from the standpoint of sympathy, and ... indecipherable.

431
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,860
[Sharlene]: Yeah, okay, so how to reduce the stigma with

432
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:51,260
people who influence your product or website or work, who aren't there yet.

433
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,000
Right? Okay ...

434
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,060
Without resorting to you're going to get sued.

435
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,920
Which is ... you know, I mean I hate to use it, but its a really good strategy.

436
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:10,040
That is, to me, in my opinion, the only reason why the U.S. government gives a shit about disabled veterans.

437
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,380
Bluntly, that is the only reason.

438
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:22,060
That said, there other two options, which is, popularity or pain point, right?

439
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:30,560
Those are two very good drivers when you're at the table with people in charge of your product.

440
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,660
Pain point ... so I've done some really sneaky things in the past.

441
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,260
I've known some CEOs who have that big office, you know, studded with windows,

442
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,260
meet them around the time when their sun is going to hit their monitor.

443
00:38:52,640 --> 00:39:00,560
There's nothing less readable then a really refined design on a LCD monitor in bright sunlight.

444
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,980
It's very similar to this kind of display.

445
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,700
You want high contrast because ...

446
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,860
you want that corner office person to say,

447
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,160
Other cooler office people cannot see this?

448
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,240
You want them to say that, you know?

449
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,960
Popularity like ...

450
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,640
my clients are advisors, and they re in the business of being ...

451
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,480
... hey, look at me, I have all the money.

452
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
Don't you want me to make you more money?

453
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,580
So they always want to appear competent, right?

454
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,480
Hugh pain point for them is when they are embarrassed.

455
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,740
So ... you want to make sure things are usable for them, right?

456
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:52,000
If I have a colorblind advisor, and they're embarrassed, and they ditch my software,

457
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,020
that's ... 25 grand a year lot to my company ...

458
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,860
That's worse than being sued. Being unpopular is actually worse than being sued.

459
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,980
People can recover from law suites.

460
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,260
You don't recover if your business loses all its customers.

461
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,780
And good will is a big deal, you know.

462
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:22,120
Like ... more and more, as the competition and especially tech get saturated,

463
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:28,280
people are getting very exhausted by people turning out the same idea over and over again

464
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,660
with just slight differences, a tweak in the name,

465
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,240
a different button over here, people are exhausted by that now.

466
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,580
The only differentiator that is going to matter in the end is customer service.

467
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,820
You know, I'm with T-Mobile.

468
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,600
They do not have any service outside the city.

469
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,080
But I don't care f I have to call them.

470
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,740
I would pay someone else to call Verizon.

471
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,380
I would absolutely pay someone else to call AT&T for me.

472
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,300
[Laughter]

473
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,200
You know?

474
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,720
So, that's a harder pitch I would say to make.

475
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,360
But if you could do the research,

476
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:12,460
if you could put the numbers in front of people of what the actual retention ...

477
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,580
like, this is where working with business side is very helpful.

478
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:21,380
They can tell that CEO exactly what each lost customer costs

479
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,300
and what it costs to get a new customer.

480
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:30,320
Costs to get a new customer rather than to retain a customer is much higher.

481
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,300
They respond to that.

482
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,100
[Dennis]: One thing I just wanted to add to that.

483
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,160
I do think, and this is not only the executive levels,

484
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:48,540
but this is for developer, designer, anyone who needs to consider accessibility.

485
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,380
It's ... its a harsh word but its true.

486
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,960
There's a cluelessness.

487
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:04,120
So you hear ... [indecipherable] ... I've had designers come to me, like, so, let me take a step back.

488
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:09,120
I used to work for an airline headquartered here in Chicago,

489
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:15,060
I've had designers who come to me and say, blind people don't use our website.

490
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,280
I said, they don't fly?

491
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,320
[Laughter]

492
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,400
It's funny, I see them all the time being ... one of the first things you hear at the gate,

493
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
is disabled people get to go first.

494
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,660
So, yeah, they do fly.

495
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:33,620
One of the tactics that we used was to create awareness,

496
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,940
by taking one of our Managing Directors, brought them into a conference room,

497
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:43,200
set them up with a laptop, and said, okay, book a flight.

498
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,620
As he went to reach for the mouse, I unplugged it.

499
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,800
[Attendee]: Good man.

500
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,160
[Dennis]: I covered the track pad.

501
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,480
I said, now ... book a flight.

502
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,180
Well, just so you know, that Managing Director couldn't get off the homepage.

503
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:11,280
He uttered an expletive, and then we all of a sudden started picking up with our program.

504
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,920
[Attendee]: This is more of a follow-up to what you were talking about.

505
00:43:20,920 --> 00:44:42,980
When you come to ... indecipherable ...

506
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,360
[Sharlene]: Absolutely. So while our website is not very accessible, our products are.

507
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,280
Because those are the products being bound by the said clients.

508
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,240
You know, your Swabb, your Fidelity, your TD Ameritrade.

509
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,620
We're talking like, when we lose a client, one of those clients,

510
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,640
that's a third of a team, gone.

511
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,500
Like literally, that is what they are worth.

512
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:12,560
You know ... and I think, you know, like, this is where ...

513
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,480
this is one of the things that I have loved working at Morningstar is that I have been able to

514
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:22,760
you know, look at the same research our analysts look at, and when you look at the numbers of

515
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,860
businesses that aren't keeping up,

516
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,380
it's dismal.

517
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,500
You know?

518
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:33,480
The companies, like Keybank from Cleveland,

519
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:39,660
they took a team ... whom dd they buy the team from?

520
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,040
I forget whom they bought the team from.

521
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:47,720
But, you know, you have Adaptive Path being bought up by Northern Trust,

522
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:56,740
you know, different companies buying up these companies, these smaller groups of UX consultants

523
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,680
they are the ones that are surviving.

524
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,540
And the other companies are going down.

525
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:14,480
And, you know, it's just very basic business strategy to say, you want to be ahead of your competitors.

526
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,880
You don't want to wait for your competitors to do something, and then you have to emulate it,

527
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,780
just to retain your client base.

528
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,480
[Dennis]: I believe we have one more question.

529
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,640
And while we're going over there, we had a comment from Anna from Texas.

530
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:46,920
She says, by hiring colorblind developers, etc. ... indecipherable ...

531
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:54,160
I mean that's one of the richest things you can probably do, is to hire someone with a disability,

532
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,340
to actually work on your website.

533
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,400
Just so you know, the disability segment has the highest level of unemployment.

534
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:11,240
So ... we have the supply, and we actually do have the demand

535
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,100
to bring in that richness into our work.

536
00:47:17,160 --> 00:49:02,320
[Attendee]: I just wanted to ... indecipherable ...

537
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,820
[Dennis]: Sharlene, I want to thank you for your presentation.

538
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:15,280
[Applause]

539
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:22,380
[Dennis]: We have to be out of here by 8 o'clock so feel free to talk with your neighbors,

540
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:28,060
introduce yourself, network, feel free to ask Sharlene any questions you might have.

541

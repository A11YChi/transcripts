The Chicago Digital Accessibility & Inclusive Design Meetup presents Good Design Was Always Accessible, with Sharlene King.

**[Sharlene]:** So, I'm Sharlene, and today, we're going to talk a little bit about three examples on design and accessibility.

So, before we get started though, I wanted to talk about the baseline definition for design disability. I am going to be using a lot of quotes from an interview someone had with Charles and Ray Eames, who are very famous designers, furniture designers. And I think there are a lot of different definitions around design, right? So, we're going to start off with design job.

It is a job that is supposed to serve a purpose. And like design, there is also a lot of definitions of disability in the world. Lots of organizations have different definitions. We're going to go with the social model of disability, which is the idea that, every ability you have is really kind of temporary. Our bodies are just meat bags as I like to say.

We are all vulnerable to impairments, whether its spraining your wrist, developing a disease, being born with something that changes the way you interact with the world. And disability is what happens when the world excludes you for that difference, as opposed to just viewing you as a medical anomaly.

These are two of my favorite quotes, Brad Frost, he is one of the biggest mobile first developers. And then Stella Young is a comedian who is a disability rights activist. I think this highlights what social, the social model of disability means.

You know, if I'm with a wheelchair user, and we are crossing a street, [Indecipherable] a problem, we can both do that. If we encounter stairs, that's when the wheelchair user is disabled. And, to be honest, as someone with Asthma,  there's only so many stairs I can climb. And with each set of stairs, that list grows longer, of who can, or cannot make that journey.

So today, we'll talk lots about history. We will not be talking about best practices. These are going to be observations of things that have happened in history so, think of them as neutral ... value neutral. Neither good nor bad, they are just things that have happened.

So, our first section, which is about function and design. So, Charles and Ray Eames asked, is design constraints? Design is largely dependent on constraints, meaning ... without constraints, there's really not much to design, you're just throwing things together. And there's probably nothing more symbolic and recognizable in the world for a sign of disability, than the wheelchair. It's a universal icon.

Without irony, before the past hundred years, wheelchairs were actually a luxury item. In the 1800's, they were used as ... were called Bath Chairs. So literally, rich people using them because they didn't feel like walking at the spa. On the French Court, they were also called Roulettes. You won't find much about that because people Google roulette, and you'll get gambling. But yeah ... It was an issue of labor. They didn't expect people who needed wheelchairs to be able to use them on their own, so it was limited to the wealthy, who could afford people to run around with them. 

This all changed after the end of World War 1. And there was a really good reason for that. You suddenly had lots of people surviving their injuries because of medical advances. But those medical advances did not prevent these soldiers from becoming disabled. When you talk about losing over 2 percent of your population, you need to keep anybody who can work. Not just people who can work ideally, but anyone. So, instead of using heavy prosthetics, the Queen of England charged people with developing the aluminum prosthetic. And as you can see, it came in many different shapes and sizes, but they were all geared towards labor. And they also had an extensive vocational  program across England so disabled soldiers could pick up a trade when they came home. 

I'm talking about Britain, because in the US, we were not so good about that. In the US, the government was not prepared for the amount of people who came back from war disabled. They didn't have jobs. And then, the Great Depression hit. So, the money that disabled veterans were promised, was suddenly not available. They formed a camp outside of D.C. known as, the bonus army, Hooverville. These kind of shanty towns were so common, they were named after the President who failed to prevent them. 43 thousand people lived there. It wasn't just the veterans, who would march on D.C., but their families, too. And when the President decided to remove them, he used the actual army, General MacArthur came in with six tanks, and over a thousand people were injured during the process. Three people died, one of them was a baby. That was not very popular.

So, but while that was happening, in Germany, you had the Bauhaus School of Design, developing. You had Mies Van der Rohe, Marcel Breuer, they were designing all these chairs you probably see around Chicago a lot in waiting rooms. This one is the MR Chair. They also started developing all sorts of buildings. There's probably nothing more recognizable than a Mies Van Der Rohe building in Chicago because he ended up becoming the director of architecture down at IIT. He was also considered a valuable refugee. So many of Germany's best designers were able to come to America and influence the design here.

And in 1932, that was when the first foldable wheelchair was invented. If you really look at it structurally, ignoring what historical baggage we have, it's not too different in structure and make from that very expensive chair designed by Mies Van Der Rohe. If we compare them side-by-side, the Wassily Chair and a Wassily Chair adapted as a wheelchair, I'm not sure there's a lot of functional difference besides one has wheels.

Now on to form. So form is a very big part of design too. It is one of our most obvious constraints, right? And I think Eams, there are a couple, but the way, they said it best, we don't have compromises, we have constraints. The compromise is simply when you say the constraint doesn't matter. Or, we don't need to acknowledge it, we don't need to work with it. 

So, you have two designers, they're working full time jobs, and they make this weird machine in their apartment on the weekends. It's called the Kazam! The exclamation point is very important. And it molds plywood. They also have a friend in the military. He's a doctor and he mentions that, oh, these aluminum splints we have, they kind of hurt our soldiers more than help. As you can see how it's constructed, it's not really going to help someone who's got half a leg blown off. And it vibrates, that was the biggest problem. The way aluminum vibrates, it's very stiff. Even cyclists will tell you that they would rather ride steel versus aluminum because of the vibrations.

So they actually ended up designing this molded wood splint. And the cool thing about it was because it was pressed, it could have punch holes for things like bandages. And unlike the aluminum splint, it could be easily be molded to the contours of your muscles. At that time, it was very difficult to mass produce aluminum that way. Aluminum as mass production wasn't really an invention until the 70's, 80's, and this was in the early 50's, as people returned home from World War 2.

And there is probably not a single piece of furniture today more associated with affluent designers. The Eames Lounger. That shape of the molded plywood able to contour the shape to anybody including the Eames chair, all of those techniques were perfected while Eames was designing that splint.

But then a side thing happened. Just like today, as then, tastes changed. We started seeing homes being proliferated with these sleek, wooden designs. The Eames chair feels really comfortable and warm there, doesn't it? Hospitals kept using that tubular chrome that we saw from Bauhaus. It was affordable. The chairs you're sitting on right now are using it, because it can be cheaply mass produced and is modular.

What happens? People started associating that very design element that was once cool, with institutions, and being disabled.

So, need. That's the other part of design. That's part of the job. All of those constraints around form and function, cannot ... there is no direction without trying to figure out what the need is behind the design. So, one of the things I want to make clear, because by this point, you may think I'm saying the military is an advocate for disability ... they're not. Just like developers back in the early teens and late aughts weren't advocates for Internet Explorer Six.

**[Laughter]**

**[Sharlene]:** We just had to accommodate them. You couldn't say, yeah, screw five percent of our users. No  product manager would accept that, would they? It was a force of integration. Not awareness. And that's a really big difference between integration and assimilation, which is what we're going to talk about next with fulfilling need.

Now assimilation, a big chunk of it is, trying to disguise and hide something. You know, Theodore Roosevelt's favorite pair of glasses was something called the Pince-nez. As you can see, it doesn't even have a frame. It's just literally two pieces of glasses, held together with a piece of metal, pinched on his nose bridge. He can put it away, it's not meant to be seen, it's not a statement, it's just discreetly a visual aid.

In 1942, thanks to the invention of polarized glass, you can now have sunglasses. And the military saw sunglasses, not as a fashion statement, but as an advanced technology. Their pilots had an advantage over other pilots, because they didn't have to deal with sun glare. And that meant, you could wear glasses that weren't medical. At this point, prescription glasses were still classified as a medical appliance. Simply having a little bit of myopia meant you were disabled.

And then 1978 happened. By then, so many different types of plastics and materials had been developed. Fashion was also getting really wild back then. But also, this is something really strange, because glasses were classified as medical appliances, it was illegal to make advertisements for them. I don't know about you, but there's very few things I can think of that can be popularized without advertisements, without familiarity. So, Cutler and Gross, they hand-make glasses, even today printed the first advertisement for prescription glasses. 

You might remember Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. Or, if you've ever read the book, he became iconic for the consumption of the 80's. Well, Oliver Peoples was one of the brands he mentioned, right? All their ads were conceptual and they were considered high fashion. By the 90's, it was now ... it reached counter culture. I don't think you can really, safely say something is embedded in culture, so there is a counter culture around it. Kurt Cobain proudly wore glasses. He wore women's sunglasses. Lisa Loeb popularized the cat-eye glasses. Christian Slater is just a handsome dude from that time period.

**[Laughter]**

**[Sharlene]:** It's to the point now where one out of five pairs of prescription eye frames did not have prescriptions in them. 75% of the U.S. needs some sort of corrective lens, whether it is contact lenses or bifocals or even just the negative positive adjusters you could buy for reading at a grocery store, 75% of us needs something like that. But nobody would think that ... medium or impaired reading glasses makes you disabled. 

But that's what integration is. It's when ... instead of it being something that where trying to disguise, it is a value neutral aspect of yourself. You know? Having blond hair is not good or bad. Um ... that may be arguable ... And so, in that interview with Charles and Ray Eames, the final question is, what is the future of Design? And they never answered it.

And you know, like, I'm kind of positioning that with us. I think it's pretty clear, even just in three examples, that if you recognize and meet this socially, and you don't stigmatize it, the function and form follows very easily and it doesn't compromise the design.

All of those designs were iconic. You know? Where's the individuality? Like, that was another reason why eyeglasses became so popular. They defined an individual, whereas the wheelchair, handed out in the hundreds and thousands, worked identical from the Army. So, yeah, that's it.

**[Applause]**

**[Dennis]:** We're going to open it up to questions. I do want to ... two things. I'm going to hand you a mic, if you have questions, and I ask that you repeat it for the live stream.

**[Sharlene]:** Sure.

**[Dennis]:** With that said, questions? Don't be bashful ... Yes ... oh, I have to remind myself ...

**[Attendee]:** Thank you. I was wondering if you could maybe just talk a little bit about your work at Morningstar and  ... [indecipherable]

**[Sharlene]:** So the question was, how did my working at Morningstar lead me to my interest in accessible design? I got most of it? Okay [Laugh] So, the cool thing about Morningstar is, design is one of the main tenants, right? So, from the top down, design is valued, you know? We've always had a Chief Creative Officer. We ...  through and through, design thinking is applied at the business level. And one of the things for us is, we want to help the individual investor. That is also a core part of our mission, right? 

And you just can't think of yourself as helping people if you're able to say, well ... we don't have to worry about 2% people here. You know, as opposed to trying to get more money, since we focus on research, we're not thinking of gains, we're thinking of providing that research to s many people as possible. Our website is definitely not ... [chuckle] ...double A accessible. But ...

**[Dennis]:** Yet

**[Sharlene]:** we're working on it, yes! We're working on it. You know, it's hard to do that with a platform from 1996.

**[Laughter]**

**[Sharlene]:** Speaking of old things ... You know, it's just being in an environment where you feel like people want to care. I think it leads to interest in things where at other jobs, I was pressured to kind of put it on the back burner.

**[Dennis]:** Ok, any other questions?

**[Attendee]:** If you had the power or ability to change the way that accessibility is handled in the United States, what would you do to make the standards for websites more accessible?

**[Sharlene]:** Yes, so, if I had the power to change anything in the U.S. regarding accessibility in websites, what would I do? Okay ... So, I would probably just have people drop the stigma of being disabled as bad. You know, if I had any power. Because often, it's just ... I'm reminded when I first started doing web stuff, right? I'm at an office, an agency, they're working on their web site, they make this blog and the header image is 500 kilobytes. This is 2007, so 500 kilobytes was a lot.

And I pointed it out. I said, you know, this is a really big image, I don't think this is a good idea. And their answer was like ... their answer was, we don't want the business of anyone who doesn't have Internet fast enough for that image. So, I said ... no iPhone users? Because iPhones had just come out, and they used 2G if you remember. And they used 2G when they were at the airport. So you're saying you don't want the CEO with an iPhone who's at the airport just reading your blog and catching up on things.

That, you know ... that really pissed off the Creative Director, because saying that in front of other stakeholders, he's embarrassed. What can you say to that? And yeah, that is not the same thing as saying what if someone has dyslexia, what is someone has a visual impairment? But I don't see how Internet speed and an image, an unnecessary, garesly large image, doesn't impact the content you are consuming across different disabilities. I just made that obstacle relatable to them. So, stigma.

**[Dennis]:** Any other questions? Yes, in the back ... We're actually thankful for the people in the back with questions. Because it allows us to get our steps in.

**[Laughter]**

**[Attendee]:** Thank you for this great presentation. I'm not a designer, so ... [indecipherable] My question is more about [Indecipherable]

**[Sharlene]:** So I think that is a great question. Is there a way to make accessibility, or are there resources that make accessibility more readily accessible for the average person? [Indecipherable]

Fox News, New York Times, and the Washington Post. [Laugh] And that isn't for the lack of money. It's cause they're cheap. Often times when people try to make things really fancy, especially in web development, they inadvertently make it much less accessible. The simplest website, where you just have text ... if I made a website that looked like this slide, any screen reader could read it, no problem. Throw in a lot of buttons and interactive infographics and photos with links and carousels and suddenly ... that's a nightmare for a screen reader, unless everything is perfectly labelled, and setup.

But, to resources, that's why, like, to answer the other question, I thought, the best wish for me would be to drop the stigma. Because, if you just consider, like ... making things less difficult. If you make things better to use, unlike the fancy stuff, that inadvertently makes things more accessible. You know, just having the big room here on the ground floor, if someone wanted to get in here, and they had mobility issues, then going to the third floor. Stuff like that, you know.

And whether or not that's because you want to make more money, that gets more attention than a store that is a flight up. But ... Whatever your motivation, the more considerate you are of other's needs you know, you don't need the fancy book with the checklist, passing standards, you know, to make a website good, you just need to think, oh ... is this cool? Do I want this just 'cause it's cool, or is it easier to use?

We were just taking about that earlier, me and Dennis, about slides. My slides are always ... black, because , when I've coded, black hurts my eyes less. It just also happens to pass contrast ratios for accessibility. But by just saying, hey, black text on white screens hurts, let's not do that. You know, whereas with other presenters, Dennis has had to work with them, but they don't like the contrast, It's like, okay cool, you don't like the way it looks,  but can people see your slides?

**[Dennis]:** I'd like to just tack on to that ... [Indecipherable] ... dark backgrounds, white content, for a couple of reasons.

1. We've actually received feedback from individuals who've attended our events and said, you know, the white background, it's glaring, it hurts my eyes. Well, if you think of it, why would anyone ... [indecipherable] I've had a couple individuals who've come up to me and say, that hurts my eyes. And, you know, the last thing I want to do is to hurt people who show up to our events. So, I've actually guided presenters, to try to inform them ... [indecipherable] ... 

So you say ok, that was done for accessibility, but what about inclusiveness? We record ... right now, we're streaming ... to, believe it or not, we have a member in Katmandu, Nepal. I kid you not. I was so jazzed when I saw that. But, we stream this, and we record this. And we add the slides, so it's easier to see. And we'll add in the captions and such. But, this is much easier to see than if it were bright ... we had Marcy Sutton, who's an accessibility engineer and developer with Deque, it's an accessibility firm, and she had white background, slides, and it was just a glare. And I felt so bad, so I had to take her slides and actually incorporate them into the edited recording. But, the people on the stream, they said, yeah, I can't see anything. So they basically  ... what she was saying.

**[Sharlene]:** They invested this, for that purpose. They literally ... [Laughter] They invested this because bright hurts people's eyes, and then they can't do their thing. So, that's why I jumped back into this slide.

**[Dennis]:** Any other questions?

**[Attendee]:** I just wanted to follow-up with what you were saying about standards ... [indecipherable] ...

**[Sharlene]:** Yeah, that's a good question. So, how do I choose between customizing a feature versus using an out-of-the-box, native kind of browser solution, right? The answer is ... It depends on ... what my team ... Because, you know, it's not just being considerate of other people, but developers, when they customize something like a scrollback, oh my god, how much time are we going to add to it? [Pointing to an attendee] She's rolling her eyes!

Yeah, and I'm really greedy with my time. I want to be able to design fast, and design more. And if the developers take longer to build something, that means less of my work gets to see reality. You know? So that's just ... it's being considerate from multiple angles. And then, you know, let's say ... they give the all clear, they're like, yeah, go ahead and customize the hell out of it. 

I've actually been working on something at work. It's a card, so it's a little setup of how you sell a strategy, right? You know, it's pretty easy to think of that for products, like a t-shirt or a spoon, you know. There's a photo of said thing, and then you have the details about it, you pick your size, add to cart. It's a little more complicated for financial strategy. So, yeah, it's been fun trying to figure out how to make this communicate complex information very quickly in just one little snapshot.

So user testing, just asking people who don't have a financial background, when you look at this, what do you think this text up here means? We've actually had people say exactly what we wanted them to say. We've had people get confused, because something was just, out of the way, weird. You know, and ... listening to them is really how we drive the decisions. There are a lot of things, you know ... I wanted to do, as a designer. And, if the user says hey, it doesn't make sense, I'm compelled to drop it. The design isn't my baby, you know. And if they don't use it, it's a bad design whether I think it looks nice or not.

**[Dennis]:** I am so happy to hear you say that the design is not my baby. That is so contrary to a lot of people that I've heard. We actually have a question from the Twitterverse ...

**[Sharlene]:** Oh, okay.

**[Dennis]:** I'm so excited. This is from Anna, I believe from Austin, Texas. She asks, how would you make accessibility go mainstream, like easy steps, some simple accessibility settings, everyone, most people would love?

**[Sharlene]:** So, there are two ways that I feel people respond to accessibility. There's making it seem cool, right? You know, like the iPod, the iPhone. The iPhone did amazing things for accessible, smart technology. PDAs were not very good before the iPhone. But, then there's also, like, solving for pain points. You know, like ... 

I can't think of a single person that likes Microsoft Word. For a million reasons. Designers hate it because we can't control the text. People hate it because it's so busy up there. And when you want to do just one little thing, you have to like Google search for like, a half an hour to find that exactly how to do that thing, and ... wait, no, that didn't do the thing I wanted. And then, you start over again, and ... when you make something accessible, those kind of things, the pain points, just drop away. 

People will pay any amount of money to fix pain points. You know ... My partner really likes her Macbook Pro. [laugh] I'm partial to saving money. PCs, though, PCs are not as intuitive, the OS is Mac. There are different accessibility levels. But, just because it's simpler to use the Mac, she's willing to drop that money for the Mac. And I can't fault her for that, that's ... the whole purpose of my job. My job exists because people are willing to do that. 

And when it's not about money, you know, there's also things like ... like, people I think joke a lot about social media drives vanity. Instagram likes, Facebook likes ... but the thing is, vanity is sometimes just a confirmation you're doing things right. You know? And, if you're removing pain points, in different ways, even if it's just like, speaking up for people who don't normally get spoken up for, or helping them be more visible, that's even better. You get recognized for it. You will. I think people are worried that there's only one way to getting that recognition and that's profit. But, I think we would be mistaken.

**[Dennis]:** Any more questions?

**[Attendee]:** I was wondering if you had any tips for having taking the stigma out of conversations on an organizational level or ... [indecipherable] ... ? Because I tend to see two things. Either we get there because we say we're gonna get sued, but there's no emotional compassion at all, or, they're there, but its from the standpoint of sympathy, and ... [indecipherable].

**[Sharlene]:** Yeah, okay, so how to reduce the stigma with people who influence your product or website or work, who aren't there yet. Right? Okay ... Without resorting to you're going to get sued. Which is ... you know, I mean I hate to use it, but its a really good strategy. That is, to me, in my opinion, the only reason why the U.S. government gives a shit about disabled veterans. Bluntly, that is the only reason.

That said, there other two options, which is, popularity or pain point, right? Those are two very good drivers when you're at the table with people in charge of your product. Pain point ... so I've done some really sneaky things in the past. I've known some CEOs who have that big office, you know, studded with windows, meet them around the time when their sun is going to hit their monitor. There's nothing less readable then a really refined design on a LCD monitor in bright sunlight. It's very similar to this kind of display. You want high contrast because ... you want that corner office person to say, Other cooler office people cannot see this? You want them to say that, you know?

Popularity like ... my clients are advisors, and they're in the business of being... hey, look at me, I have all the money. Don't you want me to make you more money? So they always want to appear competent, right? Huge pain point for them is when they are embarrassed. So ... you want to make sure things are usable for them, right? If I have a colorblind advisor, and they're embarrassed, and they ditch my software, that's ... 25 grand a year lot to my company ... That's worse than being sued. Being unpopular is actually worse than being sued.

People can recover from law suites. You don't recover if your business loses all its customers. And good will is a big deal, you know. Like ... more and more, as the competition and especially tech get saturated, people are getting very exhausted by people turning out the same idea over and over again with just slight differences, a tweak in the name, a different button over here, people are exhausted by that now. The only differentiator that is going to matter in the end is customer service. You know, I'm with T-Mobile. They do not have any service outside the city. But I don't care if I have to call them. I would pay someone else to call Verizon. I would absolutely pay someone else to call AT&T for me. 

**[Laughter]** 

**[Sharlene]** You know? So, that's a harder pitch I would say to make. But if you could do the research, if you could put the numbers in front of people of what the actual retention ... like, this is where working with business side is very helpful. They can tell that CEO exactly what each lost customer costs and what it costs to get a new customer. Costs to get a new customer rather than to retain a customer is much higher. They respond to that.

**[Dennis]:** One thing I just wanted to add to that. I do think, and this is not only the executive levels, but this is for developer, designer, anyone who needs to consider accessibility. It's ... its a harsh word but its true. There's a cluelessness. So you hear ... [indecipherable] ... I've had designers come to me, like, so, let me take a step back.

I used to work for an airline headquartered here in Chicago, I've had designers who come to me and say, blind people don't use our website. I said, they don't fly?

**[Laughter]**

**[Dennis]** It's funny, I see them all the time being ... one of the first things you hear at the gate, is disabled people get to go first. So, yeah, they do fly. One of the tactics that we used was to create awareness, by taking one of our Managing Directors, brought them into a conference room, set them up with a laptop, and said, okay, book a flight. As he went to reach for the mouse, I unplugged it.

**[Attendee]:** Good man.

**[Dennis]:** I covered the track pad. I said, now ... book a flight. Well, just so you know, that Managing Director couldn't get off the homepage. He uttered an expletive, and then we all of a sudden started picking up with our program.

**[Attendee]:** This is more of a follow-up to what you were talking about. When you come to ... [indecipherable] ...

**[Sharlene]:** Absolutely. So while our website is not very accessible, our products are. Because those are the products being bound by the said clients. You know, your Swabb, your Fidelity, your TD Ameritrade. We're talking like, when we lose a client, one of those clients, that's a third of a team, gone. Like literally, that is what they are worth. You know ... and I think, you know, like, this is where ... this is one of the things that I have loved working at Morningstar is that I have been able to you know, look at the same research our analysts look at, and when you look at the numbers of businesses that aren't keeping up, it's dismal.

You know? The companies, like Keybank from Cleveland, they took a team ... whom dd they buy the team from? I forget whom they bought the team from. But, you know, you have Adaptive Path being bought up by Northern Trust, you know, different companies buying up these companies, these smaller groups of UX consultants they are the ones that are surviving. And the other companies are going down. And, you know, it's just very basic business strategy to say, you want to be ahead of your competitors. You don't want to wait for your competitors to do something, and then you have to emulate it, just to retain your client base.

**[Dennis]:** I believe we have one more question. And while we're going over there, we had a comment from Anna from Texas. She says, by hiring colorblind developers, etc. ... [indecipherable] ... I mean that's one of the richest things you can probably do, is to hire someone with a disability, to actually work on your website. Just so you know, the disability segment has the highest level of unemployment. So ... we have the supply, and we actually do have the demand to bring in that richness into our work.

**[Attendee]:** I just wanted to ... [indecipherable] ...

**[Dennis]:** Sharlene, I want to thank you for your presentation.

**[Applause]**

**[Dennis]:** We have to be out of here by 8 o'clock so feel free to talk with your neighbors, introduce yourself, network, feel free to ask Sharlene any questions you might have. Thank you.

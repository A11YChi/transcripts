# Usable Accessibility
## Robert Kingett - Wednesday, April 27, 2016
[Source recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-VKODQ_-4Y)

**[Robert]** Howdy y'all, I am Robert Kingett and I am I'm a person that wears a lot of hats.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,220
I am a journalist, I am an author,

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,840
I am an amateur comedian

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,940
I am a columnist

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:49,260
and I am an advocate who happens to be number one

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,940
incredibly handsome

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:58,440
and number two, blind and vision impaired.

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,240
And I'm here today

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,620
to essentially tell all of you guys why having your

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:22,000
sites and or applications is a good idea

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,280
to have your sites and or applications accessible.

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:39,780
So to preface the talk,  I will open up with a little tale.

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:53,120
In November of 2014, a friend and I were at the park

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:01,760
and we were talking about Net neutrality and the FCC

18
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:09,480
and Net neutrality rules and regulations and all that

19
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:17,780
and he presented a dare to me.

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,700
And the dare was not to use any Internet

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,560
for a whole month, at all.

22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,640
In the twenty first century, I could not use Internet at all.

23
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:51,500
And if you want to read about that, you could

24
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:59,220
buy my book "Off the Grid: Living Blind Without the Internet"

25
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:12,000
I learned that the Internet is a utility.

26
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,840
It helps us to create jobs for those who can't travel

27
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,980
and it's a great resource if you know how to use it

28
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:34,020
and if you stay off of horrible, horrible forums like

29
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,620
porchen and h-chen and all of those.

30
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,800
It really can open up someone's

31
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:57,260
world, and it can broaden their horizons

32
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,580
if it's accessible to everyone

33
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,760
There's a common myth that if an application

34
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,960
or a site is usable, it's accessible.

35
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,540
And that's not entirely the case.

36
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,680
For someone who uses a screen reader,

37
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:29,320
like me, your code has to be

38
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,600
your code has to have labels in it,

39
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:46,820
it has to have elements that tell the screen reader

40
00:04:46,820 --> 00:05:02,140
what this is, and how we should interact with it.

41
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,280
A great example

42
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:17,520
I like to use often is edit fields.

43
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:27,420
If you're using a screen reader

44
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,260
changes are you're going to tab through

45
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,760
multiple edit fields.

46
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:46,160
And if you hear "edit" and nothing else,

47
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:57,280
your thinking, "Okay, what am I filling in?"

48
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:06,140
So, it is incredibly important to have your

49
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,100
edit fields labeled, have your links labeled

50
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:17,200
in a way where everybody knows where they lead.

51
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,140
For example, if I'm looking at a blog,

52
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:32,960
and I'm an advanced user, so I navigate very differently

53
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,540
than a person who is just learning how to use

54
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:47,580
NVDA or JAWs, which is a screen reader.

55
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,500
I would navigate via elements.

56
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,700
I would tell my screen reader to, okay,

57
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,720
show me a list of all the links on the page.

58
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,800
And if I scroll through all those links

59
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,540
and every link is "click here," "click here,"

60
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:15,160
or my favorite ... "click here,"

61
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,260
[laughter]

62
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,680
it's incredibly hard to know, ok, what do these links ...

63
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,820
A person who might use, you know,

64
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:39,560
interpretive mouse inputs or keyboard input

65
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,360
might actually like how those links are

66
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:53,720
because they're short and maybe in their case

67
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,840
it's easier to click on.

68
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:08,180
So that's why I strongly advocate for user testing.

69
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:18,640
I heard consultants who know their stuff

70
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,220
because I'm going to be honest with you,

71
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,820
no matter how long you use a screen reader,

72
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,820
you're just never going to learn as much

73
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:37,460
as a person who uses it every day of the week.

74
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:48,420
And, also, if you hire accessibility consultants,

75
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:58,120
you're giving a lot of disabled people a job that they

76
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,440
that they have never thought about.

77
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:13,400
So, and I'm sure everybody in this room wants

78
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:23,280
to help out our economy, in some way or another.

79
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:32,680
I have low vision also, so I use high contrast

80
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:42,580
on my Windows machine, so everything is quite

81
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,780
text on black surface, it's easier to see.

82
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,420
And, one time, I asked the developer, I said

83
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,700
"Ok, well, can you make this accessible for high contrast

84
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,700
because I'm running through your site and

85
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:11,320
I'm testing it and the developer asked

86
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,400
"well, how many people actually use high contrast?"

87
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,000
I said that kind of doesn't matter.

88
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,780
It's kind of like the old adage, if you build it

89
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,540
they will come.

90
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:38,980
If you make your sites and apps and software accessible

91
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,520
more people will use it, more people

92
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,740
will tell other people about your services

93
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,320
and then more will flock to you and say

94
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,020
I love you very much, you're totally awesome,

95
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,280
that kind of thing

96
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,100
So it's ... the blind community talks

97
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,100
and we know how to talk amongst ourselves

98
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,440
we know how to create a flurry of

99
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,520
testimonials on Twitter, we know how to

100
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,200
get the word out about your product

101
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,040
or service out there.

102
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:37,120
Recently, I won a many year long campaign

103
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:45,140
against Netflix, for their inaccessibility.

104
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:56,680
And, this is getting into the dark side of not making

105
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,680
site and service accessible.

106
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,120
You will get a lot of

107
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:29,880
push back, and it's not because we just want to

108
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,940
create havoc for you. We just want to use your

109
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:43,120
application or service or product.

110
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,840
One myth I hear all the time and this is when I

111
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,680
talk to developers and everything, they say that

112
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,240
well, I don't have enough money to make my

113
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,400
site or app accessible.

114
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,240
So, then I say, okay, well how are you able to

115
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,180
write your code then, because obviously

116
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:19,840
you're writing your code on a free and or open source

117
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,140
software, if you have any money to make your site

118
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:31,380
its all code. So it literally

119
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,700
does not cost you any monetary value

120
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,700
it just costs you a little time, and sometimes a little

121
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,680
problem solving, and sometimes a little

122
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,580
bit of asking questions and receiving feedback

123
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,540
from the community that you're trying to

124
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,860
make accessible.

125
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,500
There's companies out there that have a team of

126
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,040
contractors who will go through your site and or app

127
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,180
and or service

128
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,360
give you feedback.

129
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:35,620
and one of these is a company I work with

130
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,640
its called AccessibilityOz.

131
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,560
They ... what I like about companies like that is

132
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,400
they take in a lot of people who use a lot of

133
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:09,540
adaptive technology, so you get a lot of feedback.

134
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,120
One thing to note about

135
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:26,100
hiring accessibility consultants however is

136
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,100
sometimes they think they're all that and

137
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:37,160
they are not really interested in improving your service

138
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,360
they just want to tell you to do things.

139
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,120
So that is one thing I

140
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:54,600
take into account when I consult others on their apps

141
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,540
and sites is okay, well if I were

142
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,680
a beginning user who has never used a screen reader

143
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,360
and how would I navigate?

144
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:19,940
So, like anything else, accessibility

145
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:29,360
is not a one size fits all solution.

146
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,740
Something that might be accessible for me

147
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:43,000
might not actually be accessible to someone else

148
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,580
because they haven't learned how to, say,

149
00:16:50,960 --> 00:17:00,240
have you do links list in JAWS or NVDA.

150
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:13,400
And this harkens back to usability and accessibility

151
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,140
and the differences between the two.

152
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:25,340
Let's look at the open source community for a bit.

153
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,540
LibreOffice

154
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:37,480
which I use to write very controversial articles on things

155
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:46,100
is halfway accessible. It's completely usable

156
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:53,440
it's just halfway accessible to someone

157
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,320
using a screen reader, except the community over there

158
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:09,680
is great, although you get a few developers who again

159
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,260
they think usability and accessibility

160
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,760
are exactly the same, and

161
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:24,460
its always interesting to have to explain it

162
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:32,180
it's almost like you have to explain the difference

163
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:41,160
between a brownie and a cupcake

164
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,240
[laughing]

165
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:52,960
One thing that I see a lot of people do

166
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,320
in terms of development is that they want to make

167
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,940
their sites incredibly flashy, like have moving images

168
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:09,360
and flashy animations and everything of that nature.

169
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,980
That's all great, except you also have to remember that

170
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,200
this is 2016 and chances are someone is going to

171
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,980
go to your website on a iPhone or an iPad

172
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,860
or something of that nature, not a desktop computer.

173
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:39,920
so if your site is made out of, let's say Flash

174
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,600
for example, and I have seen this happen several times

175
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,240
your site is made out of Flash,

176
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:56,480
then how are these mobile devices going to access

177
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,020
the Flash. So you have to integrate

178
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:09,000
usability and accessibility early on

179
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,180
otherwise it is going to be really hard for you

180
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,920
later down the road.

181
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,720
From a coding standpoint and from a

182
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,620
frustration, uh I just want to pull my hair out

183
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,780
because these disabled people want to use my site

184
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,280
and I have no idea how to do this, kind of thing.

185
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:49,100
When I talk about inclusion, I also stress very much so

186
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,160
that you don't make an alternative accessible mirror

187
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:06,100
of your site. Because, you're just one developer.

188
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:15,200
so changes are you won't have the time to update your

189
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,980
separate mobile site on this other server

190
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,520
try to have everything integrated into one

191
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,160
if at all possible. Make your main site and or app

192
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:37,760
accessible, try not to have a separate version

193
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,820
of your site or app because number 1

194
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,480
it kind of makes us feel

195
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,840
like ok, we're like second natured to them

196
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,420
so we don't matter enough to where they can't

197
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:10,160
include us when they are designing their main site.

198
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,880
And, number two, it's hard on you as a developer

199
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,020
to try to maintain two applications

200
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:27,720
rather than one application.

201
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:36,120
A lot of people today use sites like

202
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,400
Wix or Squarespace or Weebly

203
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,820
to design their sites.

204
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:54,240
If at all possible, try not to rely on them

205
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:04,520
for accessibility because they will fail

206
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:11,960
because none of their platforms were designed with

207
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,620
accessibility in mind

208
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,160
so if you just make a site with any of them

209
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:27,480
with Wix or Squarespace, chances are that

210
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:35,380
number one, you're not going to be able to edit all

211
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,100
your code, and number 2

212
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,200
it is such a

213
00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:04,480
basic site that accessibility has not been considered on

214
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,320
their end, so you have to go off and

215
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,360
have to clean up all the mess.

216
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,920
There is one exception to this however,

217
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:23,380
if you are making a site using WordPress, and

218
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:29,700
their platform is entirely accessible and

219
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:39,120
there are accessible feeds out there so you don't have to

220
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,480
do anything or much of anything extra

221
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:57,060
You might have to fiddle with some alt text

222
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:02,920
here and there, you might have to fiddle with

223
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:12,660
a few headers and things but overall you'll save yourself

224
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:18,320
a lot of work and time and energy.

225
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:27,180
The last thing I want to talk about and

226
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,500
I'll take questions afterwards

227
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,740
I'm sure you guys know that in 2016,

228
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,440
alt text is a good thing.

229
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,340
It improves your sales and

230
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,400
it improves your accessibility as well.

231
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:51,020
Because, Google will crawl the web for alt text and

232
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:57,000
if you have good alt text on your images

233
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,520
Google will place your site higher than anyone elses

234
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,680
So you as a developer ought to be going "Yes!"

235
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,160
So, yes, I know it takes a lot of hard work to

236
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,340
write a few lines of extra code.

237
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,700
And yes, that was sarcasm.

238
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,740
[Laughter]

239
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:31,260
But in the end, it helps everybody, it helps you,

240
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:42,440
and it helps the end user as well.

241
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:58,980
So, to conclude, if you want to visit me on the web or

242
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,080
check out my journalism or if you want to

243
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:14,320
read my dating column about the very attractive men

244
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:22,140
that I go out with, you can find all of that on the Internet

245
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:34,280
at blindjournalist.wordpress.com.

246
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,640
Thank you everybody.

247
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,440
[Applause]

248
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,500
[Dennis] I have a question. From the time that you ...

249
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,540
When did you first start online?

250
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:56,700
[Robert]: I first, um, do you mean writing online?

251
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,340
[Dennis]: Well ...

252
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,200
[Robert]: Or all of the above?

253
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,300
[Dennis]: All of the above.

254
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,800
[Robert]: Oh, like, many moons ago.

255
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:12,860
When I was itty bitty, as we say in the country.

256
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,800
Like about eight or nine, and I was hooked

257
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:31,120
on the Internet. I had more vision than I do now,

258
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,980
so I wasn't using screen readers back then

259
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:43,860
and even if I was, it was just to read really really long

260
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:56,040
articles and forums posts about Star Wars vs. Star Trek

261
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,040
[Dennis] So, would you say that, from the time that you

262
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,220
more depended on assistive technology to today,

263
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,720
and actually this reminds me of a question

264
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,980
that always comes up in the screen reader survey that

265
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,280
WebAim comes out with annually

266
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,280
How is the Internet doing today? I mean I know

267
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,780
it was awful I mean two or four years ago.

268
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,080
Would you say, in your circles, is it an improvement,

269
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,180
improving and where would you say it is improving?

270
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,240
Obviously, Facebook and Twitter, they're now offering

271
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,560
alt text, so that's leaps and bounds now, but ...

272
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,200
from your experience ...

273
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,340
[Robert]: From my experience,

274
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,780
I see things improving now

275
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:03,280
because of the legal cases that happened in the past

276
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,180
I think that the web has improved dramatically

277
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,360
there are a lot of blind people who would vehemently

278
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,060
disagree with that admission.

279
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,700
I tell them, hey, look,

280
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:26,860
you don't have as awesome hair as I do, so yeah.

281
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:37,240
In terms of pure design, I would say that the web

282
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:44,340
has improved greatly. And I really think that it has finally

283
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,500
starting to sink in that, oh, hey

284
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:57,980
disabled people like go online and stuff.

285
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,480
Like it's not a phenomenon any more.

286
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,120
However, in terms of content, that's where things

287
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,320
really need improvement because even now

288
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:19,040
captions hardly exist on the Internet.

289
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,840
You have these automated captions that

290
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,160
just aren't sufficient. And a lot of people think

291
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:37,340
a lot of people are lazy even to me and they're like

292
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:44,420
"Oh, I don't need to caption my videos because

293
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,280
Google will caption it for me."

294
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:54,680
And that's not the kind of attitude we should have.

295
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:04,600
But it's an attitude I see even in today's laziness.

296
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,000
[Dennis] Yeah, it's funny that you say that.

297
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,020
I have a personal and profession experience with the

298
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,180
autocaptions. This meetup, in December,

299
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,700
we tried Google Hangouts for the first time just to see

300
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,940
how it would work.

301
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,680
And, one of our assistant organizers at the time

302
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,940
he had bandwidth problems, and I happened to catch

303
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,420
it was already set on autocaptions, I hadn't set it up

304
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,200
from the get go because I didn't know that much about

305
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,620
Google Hangout at the time, but the bandwidth

306
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,560
issues were so strong that the autocaptions

307
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:56,460
at one point of time, our male assistant organizer

308
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,380
was quoted in the captions as having a juicy "arse."

309
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,900
[Laughter]

310
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,960
[Dennis]: That's not something that you

311
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,580
want to be public.

312
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:16,620
Professionally, I work for United Airlines and we publish

313
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,920
a lot of videos, like your flight safety videos,

314
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,180
your ... we have this "Big Metal Bird" thing which

315
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,920
I'll be honest, I don't get yet. But I'm slow, so...

316
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,440
And they have thought that they could get away with

317
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,240
autocaptions. What has amazed me is, until I

318
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,560
called them on it and said "What are you doing?"

319
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,480
I don't think they ever turned on captions to see what

320
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,200
the captions said. And it was beyond embarassing

321
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,660
to the brand, what they were allowing to be public.

322
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,740
So we had to call them out and say

323
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,680
click the captions there, and it wasn't twenty seconds

324
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,860
until they were like "Oh my god!"

325
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,480
It's like, this is a two minute video, and it takes,

326
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,120
because you already have the script, it takes

327
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,120
ten, fifteen minutes to get the captions synced up

328
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,720
and put on. You couldn't have done that?

329
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,280
Now it's part of their workflow. But it's only

330
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
when they saw the shock and horror

331
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,180
of what autocaptions provides.

332
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:38,260
[Robert]: Yeah, and also, just from a PR standpoint,

333
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,720
you don't want the media to report on you

334
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,560
or let's say me, you don't want me to report

335
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:54,340
in the Chicago Tribune, like, United Airlines has horrible

336
00:34:54,340 --> 00:35:04,900
captioning. So, yeah, it's just good practice.

337
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:10,980
And I'm sure that a lawsuit is not something you want

338
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,660
in the future either, so.

339
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,720
[Dennis]: Well, we're mandated by the government

340
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,960
anyways, so there's still a compliance thing there.

341
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,720
[Steve]: You mentioned some conversation about

342
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:34,500
alt tags, and I'm wondering what's most meaningful

343
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,360
both from a SEO standpoint and from a

344
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,420
usability standpoint?

345
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:45,920
For instance, you could really describe a photo well

346
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,360
or you could just do it in a cursory way.

347
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,600
"Child playing with block on floor."

348
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,920
"Three-year-old, cheery, preschool child in Evanston,

349
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,120
Illinois, playing with a block on the floor."

350
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,320
What would you advocate?

351
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,860
[Robert]: From a sales standpoint and

352
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,160
from a user standpoint, I would say

353
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,660
try to limit your alt text to two sentences.

354
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:25,680
Try to limit your alt text to one sentence.

355
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:34,680
If you're not a good writer, you could just hire me.

356
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,420
[Laughter]

357
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,220
[Robert]: But if you're not a good writer

358
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,760
I would look at websites that have alt text

359
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,700
with just one sentence.

360
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,860
Some websites, even though they are

361
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,200
for the blind and the vision impaired,

362
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,740
sometimes even they go way overboard with alt text.

363
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,300
Like, I was looking at a consulting website

364
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,240
and their alt text for their logo is literally

365
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,860
a paragraph long,

366
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:23,600
So, I was just like "Woa." How do you describe a logo?

367
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,920
They were saying the color of the logo,

368
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,620
how large the letters were,

369
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,780
I was like, "no."

370
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,660
[Laughter]

371
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,060
It's like way too much information so

372
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:42,540
try to edit. So from sale and user experience,

373
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:49,880
try to limit to one or two sentences.

374
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:57,380
Also, when you are writing alt text,

375
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,180
what is most important to you in the picture?

376
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:11,600
When you look at the picture, what stands out to you?

377
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:18,460
So I hope that answers your question.

378
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,080
[Steve]: Yeah, thank you.

379
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,560
[Dennis]: Any other questions?

380
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,700
[Attendee]: The group that you referred to for consulting

381
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,460
to review your website,

382
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,980
are companies like that more geared for enterprise-level

383
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,680
type of jobs, or are they ... there's a lot of consultants

384
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,200
that just have a bottom line that, it's not accessible

385
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,200
from a finance standpoint, for small sites, small apps,

386
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,060
start ups, that kind of thing.

387
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:59,000
[Robert]: For those kind of sites, like AccessibilityOz,

388
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,100
they're more for enterprise and they're more for

389
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,400
companies rather than individuals, so if you're

390
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,900
an individual, I would suggest looking for

391
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:17,720
a freelance accessibility consultant.

392
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,400
If you're not satisfied with one, never hire them again.

393
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:40,620
That's ... typically freelance accessibility consultants

394
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:51,740
charge around forty to seventy dollars an hour.

395
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,520
I did see a lady charge eighty dollars an hour,

396
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,620
and I just had to take her site and say

397
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:10,120
"look, honey, individual people who are just

398
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,220
making a website for the first time, they are not

399
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:20,440
going to have that much money.

400
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:29,520
And her whole market, she tried to market to

401
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:39,660
to individuals, and so. In answer to your question,

402
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:45,060
Companies like AccessibilityOz and others,

403
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,640
yeah, they're geared more towards corporations

404
00:40:49,640 --> 00:41:02,340
and enterprises. If you can afford their services,

405
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:10,180
hire them. Hire them for the shear fact that

406
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,240
you get a lot of opinions versus one.

407
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,900
So, anybody have any other questions?

408
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,180
[Dennis]: Any other questions?

409
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:31,300
[Attendee]: I know there is a number of WCAG guidelines

410
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,080
out there. Rather than read through the guidelines,

411
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,280
is there a Website Accessibility for Dummies book?

412
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,060
[Robert]: No.

413
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,860
[Laughter]

414
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:44,760
[Dennis]: And actually there is. It has a red cover.

415
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,980
I can't think of it off hand. But it's supposed to

416
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,760
take WCAG, and it's 2.0, and I think it's called

417
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,580
WCAG 2.0 Made Easy. I think that's the name of it.

418
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,240
It puts WCAG in, what I'll call, common language.

419
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,860
It's fine, its good, and actually there is,

420
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,640
and I don't know the URL off the top of my head

421
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,520
but I just found, this past week,

422
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,780
I think it's called, Interactive WCAG

423
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:24,980
and it has a lot of filters. It basically strips out

424
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,480
what you're not looking for. Like if you're just looking for

425
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,380
what you're not looking for just like ...

426
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,860
things that deal with images, so your alternative text,

427
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,600
contrast, it'll just show you those things.

428
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,060
So, you can actually filter down to maybe

429
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,540
just what you are looking for instead of

430
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,900
scanning through this forty-three page,

431
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,140
you know, if it were printed, forty-three page ...

432
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,440
[Laughter]

433
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,500
But yeah, WCAG is dry.

434
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,540
One thing that came out of CSUN,

435
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,060
and actually Karl Groves, the Viking in

436
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,880
the Viking and the Lumberjack,

437
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,920
he said, and I knew this but It didn't resonate

438
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,300
until he said it at CSUN. It was like, you go to WCAG,

439
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:17,200
you'll have all the principles and the guidelines and such

440
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,380
and then on the right side you'll see "Understanding"

441
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,760
and then whatever this critique is.

442
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,860
Read that.

443
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:31,320
That goes into, I'm not going to say plain English, but

444
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,480
it puts it into common English, what they are referring to

445
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,400
and it goes into more details than just having these

446
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,460
statements or these bulleted lists.

447
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,440
Any other questions for Robert?

448
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,000
[Attendee]: What comes after Netflix?

449
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:58,840
[Laughter]

450
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,400
[Robert]: My next target is Hulu.

451
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:14,500
Because their site ... they still use Flash in 2016.

452
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,080
Yeah, so, Hulu

453
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:27,840
I want to go after educational sites more because

454
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:34,300
I've learned that colleges are the worse at making

455
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:41,540
their sites accessible ... apart from the government,

456
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:49,100
the government actually, ironically, if you go to a site

457
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:54,180
that is made by our government, if you look

458
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,700
at their code, you would see it is horrible

459
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:06,940
in terms of accessibility, there is two, there is a thing

460
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,900
where having too many accessibility options

461
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:16,420
the government kid of over reaches, and it makes

462
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,340
their sites incredibly hard to use.

463
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:27,540
They try to cater to one disability, and it makes it hard

464
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,540
for everyone else to use the stuff.

465
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,340
[Dennis]: Last question...

466
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,720
[Attendee]: I have one.

467
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,680
Where do you hang out on the Internet?

468
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:50,920
[Robert]: Oh my. Well, I'm a frequent Reddit user

469
00:45:50,920 --> 00:46:02,300
I mostly am on Twitter. I am tweeting idiotic hashtags

470
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,220
like #cupcakesrule

471
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,800
[Dennis]: That's hope I found Robert

472
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,380
[Laughter]

473
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:19,860
[Robert]: I am incredibly vocal in the media

474
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:33,040
I pop up every now and then on Facebook, not so much.

475
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:41,120
I tend to hang around Reddit a lot more right now

476
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,020
than I did in the past.

477
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:51,540
I you want like a central place to hunt me down

478
00:46:51,760 --> 00:47:03,000
you can go to my website

479
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,940
blindjournalist.wordpress.com

480
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:22,480
My Twitter is @theblindwriter. So, yay!

481
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:32,240
Also, just a little, shameless plug,

482
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:38,940
I also have a Patreon account, so if you want to

483
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:44,320
make a donation because you like my column about

484
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,540
some really hot man over here in the corner,

485
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:54,460
then you can make a donation to

486
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:05,820
patreon.com/blindwriter

487
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:12,840

I'll holler at you.

491
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,940
[Dennis]: Well, thank you very much, Robert.

492
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:41,340
[Applause]
